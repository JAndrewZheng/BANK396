So I met my girlfriend in a game of kickball,
I had kicked the ball and was trying to run
all bases, While on my way from second to third
base I was running while turned around so I could
see the ball so while I wasn’t looking I ran
into a girl on the other team. I was running
hard and accidentally threw her to the ground, not knowing
her I was embarrassed and sorry for running into her.
I helped her up and then all this time later
she is now my girlfriend. We were talking today about
how we met and how funny it was later on.
I said “I can’t believe you fell for me that
quick after meeting me” We laughed and I thought I
should share. I understand this has nothing to do with
any of you but It felt right, Hope all of
you have a good day and good bye.

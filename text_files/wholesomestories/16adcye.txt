I work in retail and had the lady in her
80’s at my register and I complimented her jewelry and
hair. She said how she has cancer and hates her
hair  for how there’s patches. I told her regardless
she is beautiful and that one of my sisters had
cancer also and how strong people who have or had
it are. I told her regardless of her hair and
how she feels she looks amazing. The customer cried and
she hugged me for being so nice and she even
came in today telling me that she was officially cancer
free as of today and that she was hoping I
was here today as she knew I’d be beyond happy
and she thanked me for making her feel beautiful when
she didn’t at one point.

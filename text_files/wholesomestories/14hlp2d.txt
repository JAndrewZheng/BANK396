My cat had a home.The best home she could ever
have.She loved it there.She was adopted from a shelter when
she was a small kitten.She was such a sweet kitten.Her
owners loved her.We found her when she was about a
year or two old.She walked right up to us when
we passed an alley.We took her to the vet and
did all the necessary things we needed to do.We then
adopted her.She had such a tough life.Please don't abandon your
pets.They don't deserve it.

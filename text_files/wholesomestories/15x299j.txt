Ok so this is a tiny story but I still
wanna post it bc it made my day brighterI live
in an apartment complex with another one right outside my
windows with some grass and sidewalks in between and love
people watching and often will take my laptop to do
some excel work on the balcony to see if anything
interesting happens. Usually there's nothing special, tho I see some
cute dogs, cats and sometimes stumble across some neighborhood drama.
(I don't consider myself nosey but writing this all out,
turns out I might be a little, lol)Today I did
the same and 15 minutes after I started I saw
all the entries to the other apartment complex open and
a person with a dog walked out from each (There
is like 4 entries).That already made me smile bc they
looked like they rehearsed it so the doors will open
perfectly in sync.Then they all sorta met in the middle,
let their dogs play on the grass and now are
just standing there talking and laughing.It's a tiny thing but
I feel like I'll see them do this more often
^^

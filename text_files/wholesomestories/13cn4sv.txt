So a little bit of backstory. My husband is a
heavy metal fan and Sabaton is his favourite band. He
was at one of their concerts a few years back
and really liked it. On with the story. So Sabaton
had a concert this Sunday and my husband really wanted
to go but didn't had the money(we keep our finances
seperate he pays the fix costs and I pay for
groceries and other daily needs).So I decided to pay for
it and make it an early Christmas gift and he
really appreciated it. So on Sunday we first had a
beautiful day with our kids at Sch√∂nbrunn(a zoo in Vienna)
and then he went to the concert(I don't like metal
that much and it would have been too loud for
me anyway). I said he should text me when he
is home safe(I drove to my parents who live closer
to Vienna so I didn't had to drive 2 1/2
hours home). He did and also wrote that the concert
was mega and thanked me again so I know the
decision was right and on top I don't have to
think about a Christmas present for him anymore.

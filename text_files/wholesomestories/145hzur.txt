My female friends and I (52F) frequently & casually say
"I love you" to each other - when saying goodbye,
ending a phone conversation, on birthdays, etc.The other day I
overheard a friend's 17-year-old son talking to a friend on
the phone, and he ended the conversation by saying "bye,
I love you."  It made me so happy that
teen boys are comfortable saying that to their friends. They'll
grow up into men who knows how to express their
emotions and I love that. <3

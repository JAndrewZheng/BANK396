I have never posted on Reddit before, but it’s 3
am and I can’t sleep. I just want to share
this to hopefully inspire someone. I don’t have many friends
so I came here. 9 years ago, I graduated high
school and started working on my degree, but I wasn’t
100% sure what I wanted to go for. I later
decided to drop out due to several issues. (personal, financial
etc.) In fall of 2020, I decided to apply to
a college in the new state I moved to and
I was accepted. I decided the first class I would
take would be the one I found hardest in high
school and the one that scared me away from my
initial degree plan. I took the class and passed, with
an A! I then worked diligently, while working full-time to
finish my AA degree. Tomorrow I walk across the stage
after 9 years.The thing that makes it super wholesome for
me though is that in just a couple weeks I
will be driving 8 hours back to my hometown to
surprise my little sister who is graduating from high school!
She can’t come to my graduation because of finals, but
I plan to bring my cap and gown so we
can take pictures together after her ceremony! It’s so special
to me that we get to have this together!! I
love her tremendously and am super proud of her! PS-
I am already accepted into the bio-med program and when
my sister goes to college in the fall she will
also be going for bio-med!!! It would be so awesome
for us to graduate with our bio-med degrees together!!! :)

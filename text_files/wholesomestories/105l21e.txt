When I was pregnant I struggled with a lot of
mental health issues. My now husband joined the military while
I stayed home and worked. My at home life wasn’t
the greatest and I was extremely depressed. So after work
one day I didn’t want to go home. I felt
like I didn’t want to face reality. It was some
odd hour of the night. But I had nowhere else
to go so I went to the local 7-Eleven and
just circled the isle until I ended up having a
complete mental breakdown in the isle and started to cry.
The person who worked there was so sweet and got
me a chair to sit on and asked me what
was going on and then gave me a free cup
of tea, calmed me down and sent me home. I’m
sure it was insignificant to her but to this day
I am grateful for her small gesture. This was a
little over 2 years ago now but if your out
there reading this 7-Elevin worker, thank you.

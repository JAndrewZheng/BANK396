Hey! This story is not so much a meme and
more of a love story of my girlfriend and I.
My whole elementary/middle school life I was the guy that
got bullied and got picked on tons. In 7th grade
i met a girl, lets call her Aphrodite. This girl
was awesome and we instantly became friends. We talked a
lot about our lives growing up and realized we were
very similar in a bunch of different ways and had
multiple of the same interests. We quickly learned that we
actually were neighbors and we started walking too and from
our bus stop daily. Around Freshman year of highschool I
developed a strong crush on her but was never upset
with her if she dated other guys because I always
had a mindset that if shes happy, then im happy.
She loves all the nerdy and geeky things that i
love such as video games, StarWars, Legos, Anime, etc. and
i just couldn’t get over her. When the pandemic started
i was in the middle of my sophomore year in
highschool and luckily got her number before i left the
school.  I would always come home everyday gushing about
her to my parents and family about how perfect she
was. I hadn’t seen her in person for about 2
1/2 years but still checked in on her every couple
of months just to make sure she was doing alright.
About 8-10 months ago we started playing Minecraft a lot
together, sometimes we’d be up until 4am playing Minecraft and
talking about life. One day after I logged off i
got a text from her saying “You’re cute”. I had
never gotten a compliment before and was clearly confused and
asked her what she meant by that and she proceeded
to call me attractive and that she has found me
attractive since early highschool. I was understandably in utter shock,
i mean the only person ive ever had a crush
on is expressing that they have feelings for me and
have for a long time and so I reciprocated the
same feelings for her,.  We met when we were
12-13 and now we’re almost in our 20’s. For the
past 7 months ive been seeing her often, met her
family, and we’ve already been discussing marriage. Theres not a
single thing she does at all that annoys me or
bothers me in anyway. She’s beautiful, kind, badass, smart, and
she has the most contagious laugh. Still to this day
feels completely surreal that im with the woman ive always
wanted to be with. She is my Aphrodite. Anyway i
know not much people will see this but I just
really wanted to tell a summarized version of our story
on this sub because ive been told our story is
extremely wholesome☺️.

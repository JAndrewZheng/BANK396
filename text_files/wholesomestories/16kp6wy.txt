I was at the local small town "greasy spoon" (if
you know, then you know!) And a gentleman came in,
looked around with a weary look on his face, and
sat down at the table behind me.Without even thinking about
it, I asked the waitress to come over,, told her
I wanted to do a good deed and that id
get the guys meal, but she couldn't tell him who
did it, and id give her an okay tip as
well just to do a good dead for the day.She
gained that grin that you only get when your heart
is warmed by a kind gesture.She wrote up the tickets
and added them together and brought them over to me.
As the gentleman was eating he kept telling the waitress
how good his meal was, little did he know, he
wouldn't have to okay, and it made me feel really
good because he looked like he had been through hell
and back.As I left, he walked by coming back from
the restroom and I asked him how his meal was,
and he excitedly said "oh, it was really good! First
good meal ive had in almost a week!"... I think
I had that heartwarming look on my face as I
was walking out to my vehicle, and that really felt
great!

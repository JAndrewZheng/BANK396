I am in love with my sisters hamster , Icicles.I
got her for Christmas from my Grandma and she is
the cutest thing!I have wanted one for years.I love spending
time with her.If you have a hamster you need to
take them for a walk.I went with my mom to
get groceries last week and the shopkeeper said, "Bless you"
when I passed by and he didn't even know my
name.Then I started petting her and he said, "Your for
sure going to fall in love with that cute thing".That
made me happy because my mom was trying to find
someone to come and take Icicles for a walk.Also, I
wish all parents would let their kids play with them.I
have some experience with hamsters because my mom has two.They
are still very little and they get scared easily.But I
have fun playing with them.I like to hold them, put
them on my head and just generally have a lot
of fun.I want more hamsters and I am sure my
mom will let me have some soon.This is Lil'Cheese.She lives
in South Korea in a hamster heaven called Pet Paradise.It
is an amazing place.All of the hamsters have areas just
for them and the owners take them there and clean
them, feed them and just play with them.When I visited
it a couple months ago, I fell in love with
Lil'Cheese.

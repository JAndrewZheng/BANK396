After I left my daughter's dad I spent 4 years
believing no one would want to have a child with
me. I blamed myself and my pregnancy hormones for the
relationship ending. But I now know that's not the case.My
relationship with my daughter's dad ended because I wasn't being
treated like a spouse. I was treated like a maid
and a free prostitute..But I didn't see it like that.
Some of the things I ex would say about me
while I was pregnant with our daughter made me feel
like I was nothing but an error because other women
can do all this why can't I?But now that I'm
22 years old and finally in a healthy relationship with
a man who treats me like a equal and who
respects me as a person and spouse. And we are
currently expecting a baby.Now if I am not feeling good
I can lay down and even take a nap without
worrying about getting yelled at. I can get emotional and
cry without fear of  being told to shut up
or being forced into someone's arms. I thought I was
nothing but a monster to have a family with. But
this man proved me wrong. And continues to prove me
wrong every day.The fear of this wonderful time going away
is still present though but what helps me relax a
bit is reminding myself that I didn't make it this
long with my daughter's dad because of the mistreatment. If
my boyfriend was anything like him I wouldn't still be
here.

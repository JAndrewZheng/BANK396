My 9 yr old son has a cat but when
ever they play or cuddle he gets a rash on
his face. The other day I asked him why he
keeps playing with his cat if his face keeps getting
rashes. He said “I have the rest if my life
to worry about my face. But a limited amount of
time with my cat.” And just kept on playing with
his cat.

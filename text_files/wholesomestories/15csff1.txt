Idk if this is the right subreddit, but didn't know
where else to put it.  So, I've always struggled
with cleaning my room. I'm only 17 so I still
live with my parents. When I was 11 we moved
to the place we live now and I got my
own room for the first time. It was so empty
when we moved here but as a kid and growing
up into a teen I got more and more stuff,
a dresser from our hallway got moved into my room
and I didn't really use it, only the top of
it. Under my desk got filled with boxes full of
random toys and stuff that I never got around to
organize. My dad especially has always been nagging me about
my room and how I should learn to clean it.
I just never could. I would sometimes, like not even
once a month, clean the surface, like my desk, the
top of the dressers and the part of the floor
I had to walk on. But I was never able
to like deep clean it all.   The past
few years it's been really bad, I haven't been wanting
to invite my friends over and into my room because
I was embarresed. I thought that I didn't care. It
wasn't like filled with trash and food but just like
stuff that I haven't touched in years and clothes everywhere
and stuff like that.  But like a week ago
a friend invited me over to watch a movie after
dinner and I said yes. I had bought her a
cup and crocheted her a bag that I took with
me and gave her. She had bought me two smaller
plants. I was so excited because I've always wanted plants
in my room but all the plants I've had were
either fake or died. So I was really happy but
then when I came home it dawned on me that
I had nowhere to put them. My desk, a mess.
My floor, a mess. My shelfs, a mess. My dressers,
a mess. My nighttables, a mess... You get the point.
I got kind of sad and knew that I wanted
to take care of these plants. So I made a
plan as to the things I wanted to clean and
went to bed.  When I woke up I was
so determined and began as soon as I had eaten
breakfast. I got far the first day but I honestly
thought I could do it all in one day but
after dinner I was exhausted. So the next day I
continued and got done. I had three big garbage bags
that I struggled to get to the garbage cans outside.
In the middle of cleaning day two I cried because
it felt like I was never going to finnish but
I did. I was and still is very proud. It
was so weird seeing my room and floor so clean,
I could actually open the drawers in my dresser with
my clothes. I had organized everything underneath my desk and
got it down to like half or maybe even less
of what was there before. The first few days I
cried of happiness a few times. I'm really happy. There
are still parts of my room that I need to
clean and organize but I'm really proud of how much
I've done so far. I didn't think that my room
would have such an impact on me.   I'm
sorry for any misspellings, not from an english-speaking country.

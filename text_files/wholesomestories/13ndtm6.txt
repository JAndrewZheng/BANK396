One of my first memories is of me sleeping on
my moms stomach while she was pregnant with my brother.
I must have been 3 almost 4 at the time.
I remember listening to my mom's singing voice in my
dream and feeling her play with my hair. I only
know I was asleep because my brother kicked me in
the face and woke me up lol. Another early memory
of mine is around the same time where my step
dad sat me down and tried to explain how to
say my brothers name since I had trouble fonding the
difference pronouncing th and f like thanks and four. I
remember laughing so hard and trying so hard because I
couldn't hear the difference and my step dad was laughing
with me because laughs are contagious I'm guessing. I eventually
got it before my brother was born though lol.

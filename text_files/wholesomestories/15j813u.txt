So this was a while back when I was about
10 years old so my mother, had just gotten us
our Saturday takeout and my sister had just finished her
gymnastics practice. So while we went home she told us
a story of my great grandfather. So my great grandfather
was 11 years old at the time and he had
a best friend let’s call him Ricky. So my great
grandfather and Ricky were playing tag in some tall gra,
when suddenly Ricky stepped on a nail. She didn’t give
us the details but exactly 11 days after the incident
he was carrying his casket at the ceremony. He sadly
died of tetanus. He was extremely glad when he found
they’d made a vaccine for it, but when people refuse
to take it he felt angry. He never really let
it go, and I wish I could have met him
but sadly he died the year my mum found out
she was pregnant with me. He was described as threatening
to punch people who didn’t take the vaccine. If you
couldn’t he would be fine with it but if you
were actively not taking it that’s when he was angry.
His friend could have lived if they had the vaccine
it could’ve saved his life, and you’re refusing to take
it he will not be happy. Hopefully you understand the
reason I call him a hero, I have respect and
I feel like I’m him but different.

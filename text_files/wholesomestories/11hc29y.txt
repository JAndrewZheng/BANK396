My grandpa is in the hospital right now, and the
pastor talking with my family in the room asked my
grandparents how they met. I’d never heard this story before,
but it’s the sweetest thing. For as long as I’ve
been alive my grandparents have played bridge together, but I
didn’t know that that was also how they met. They
were in college and my grandma went to a student
socialization group with a friend of hers and that friend’s
boyfriend. She and her friend were learning to play bridge,
but they needed a fourth for the game, so her
friend went all over asking for a fourth, and my
grandpa spoke up and said he knew how to play.
And then because they played cards, they left too late
to take the buses, so my grandpa drove my grandma
home, and the rest is history. I just thought it
was so sweet that they’ve been playing cards all their
lives together, and now towards the end of his life
I’m very happy to hear this story.

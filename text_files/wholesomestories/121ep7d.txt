I don't have that many friends, so when i have
news about my life, good or bad, i usually just
ruminate on my own, but this was a wholesome thing
my dad said after his "awakening", and i thought i'd
share it with you all.on early February 2023, i (22F)
ran into some problems with my school administration that would
possibly hinder me from graduating next year. because of that
i got so frustrated and for once called my dad
to tell him the news and to apologize for not
being attentive enough in keeping up with my school schedules
and all that.after an hour of him listening to me
explain and cry and apologize, i ask him if worse
comes to worst, what if i do have to extend,
that means it'll take longer for me to graduate.He said
"it's okay, whatever happens, i will support you, i will
be here, you're not alone, but you have to try
as hard as you can to fight for this"because he
was being sooo nice (i expected him to take away
my things or something, because that's what he used to
do), i asked him "why are you being so nice?
i failed to keep up with the most basic thing,
why are you not angry?" (his tone was not in
any way upset, he was calm collected)His response was "because
i don't want to lose you again, you are my
daughter, it's my responsibility as a parent to support you
until you can support yourself" wanna know my response to
that? i cried even harder.because that was the single most
meaningful thing ANYONE has ever said to me. and this
came from my dad, who when i was 14, on
christmas, said "i don't need you, i have your little
sister, i don't care what happens to you" with the
most heartless tone i can imagine to be used to
a fourteen year old. so the complete 180‚Å∞ from back
then really sucker punched my soul.so that's it, just wanted
to put it out there that some parents do try
to change their behaviour (well, after i ran away for
6 months and built a life for my own), so
don't give up! sometimes they need some shock therapy, but
after that, if they're showing efforts to repair their relationship
with you, if it's not too damaged (and you want
to have a relationship with them), try meeting them in
the middle, you'll be surprised what waits you on the
other side.(oh and the thing i was fighting for, through
some luck or miracle, i handled it (with the help
of my parents), and i'm back studying law again üòÅ)

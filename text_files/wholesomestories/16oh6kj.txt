Not my story, but I witnessed this.So most of my
team consists of college kids, and this girl came in
to work her shift then stayed about 3-4 hrs to
do her project.So as I passed by a couple times
she wanted to talk, really to be away from the
work because it was a lot lol. Then she said
sorry my ADHD is awful, I have to get to
work, so I tried my best to not distract her
(ofc everyone else comes up to her to talk for
like 15 min) So I notice that some random customers
have started talking to her, a little odd in my
opinion, but idk. I go back and see that they're
still talking after about 10 min, I start to think
this is a little weird and maybe I should go
see what's happening. Well I don't check on it, but
I go back after the customers leave and she's crying.
I ask her what on earth did they say to
you. She can't speak because she's crying, so I say,
good or bad tears, she squeals good tears. She explains
that this couple wasn't trying to eavesdrop but they overheard
she has ADHD, and that they saw how hard she
was trying to work. They were both professionals in some
mental health field, and they basically said "We're proud of
you, keep going, you're doing great" and some other stuff
like that.And here I just nodded and kept eyeing up
their table because I haven't gotten a chance to clean
it all day lol

Alot of my clothes don't have pockets and all my
bags are huge and he always brings his crossbody 
bag. When we go out somewhere and I need to
bring things (tampons, eyeliner, lipstick) he tells me to not
worry about bringing my bag and that I can use
his because he has his anyway. He doesn't care what
needs to go in there and he doesn't care how
much goes in. I always repay it back by letting
him put things in my bag when I have mine.
It doesn't seem very wholesome to some but we live
in the UK and it's not very likely that a
13 year old boy would let his older sister put
"girly" things in his bag so to me, it's very
wholesome and I'm quite proud that he's like that considering
our mum isn't around anymore and wasn't a good role
model for him

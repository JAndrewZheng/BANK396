Ok, way back when I was bored and wanted to
play Minecraft. So I joined the party of a random
person on my friends list and asked if I could
join. That person was Quinn. They don’t talk to new
people and it takes them a bit to open up
but they spoke to me after about 5 min. That
made me feel amazing. We started hanging out I met
a friend of theirs named egg. We all hung out
and I became good friends with both of them. Then
egg and Quinn got together and I had thought “oh
no this isn’t going to end well” and in my
defense most online relationships don’t last. At this time I
also learned that Quinn was in Foster care and had
slid in to the not very good side of it.
But ya Quinn and Egg. They were together for about
two months then egg came up to me and asked
“can we talk”. I accepted sadly,assuming he was going to
break it up with Quinn. However I was surprised when
they started talking about locations in Texas. It’s important to
point out all of us are in different states. Me
in Pennsylvania. Egg in Tennessee. Quinn in Texas. And essentially
Egg was asking for help to have their family “foster”
Quinn. Originally he was taking about adoption but you can
probably see the issue I mentioned to him…..  
I helped by getting him the phone number for the
child foster agency of that area. Then fast forward to
current. Eggs whole household has agreed and submitted the proper
paperwork. It’s now a wait to see when Quinn will
get sent up! The internet helped to get a person
out of foster care and let me meet 2 amazing
people.  I was told by Quinn and Egg that
it is not wholesome and I hope you all are
willing to help me prove them wrong.

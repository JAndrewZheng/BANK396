So after a while of going through a rough patch
in my life my parents who are definitely not cat
people let me get a cat after wanting one my
whole life (I’m 21 for context) and my cat is
super adorable and I showed my 2 year old niece
a picture of him and she said “cat” and started
saying “awww” while tilting her head and smiling and I
almost cried from happiness lol

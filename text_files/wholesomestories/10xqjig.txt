Yesterday I had a long train ride and started to
feel ill, I chalked this up as motion sickness because
I was looking at my phone, and I took a
break. A while after I started feeling worse and figured
it was just because I was tired from standing (since
the train at the time was full). As my stop
approached all sound around me became muffled and it got
very hard to see. I stumbled my way out of
the train before running to a bench to throw up,
a lady standing near a pillar saw me and asked
if I was okay. She went to get the station
crew to come up to see me and she gave
me some tissues. Since she was on her way home
she asked if I had someone picking me up and
what their car looked like, she found my dad and
sent him over to get me. Sad she didn't come
up with him as I didn't get the chance to
thank her. If you're reading this, thank you so much
for showing me such kindness, I really appreciate it.

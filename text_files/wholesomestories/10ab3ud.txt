I was at the gas station with my adoptive father
and I ordered 2 slices of pizza and a Gatorade.
I was short. He paid the rest for me. He
only paid 1.85$ because I mentioned that I haven't eaten
all day. He was understanding because he went to the
same high school and we talked shit about the food.
It's always one choice, eat it or starve. It's always
greasy, salty and nasty. My schools food is nasty and
I hate it so I don't eat the school lunches.
The food is always greasy and soggy. I thanked the
guy and I'm crying a bit. There are still good
people out there.

When I was little, my grandma had a miniature, blue
teacup set, complete with three cups, respective tiny plates and
a tea can + a tin for the milk. I
absolutely loved this tiny tea set, and would always play
super carefully with it seeing it was made out of
porcelain. Now I'm 18 and still very much obsessed with
miniature things and have begun to collect them, everything from
a miniature typewriter to furniture from dollhouses.In recent years, my
grandma met someone and he moved in with her. My
grandpa died when I was small so it was about
time. This led to her rearranging a lot in her
house, and she gave us a tour of the new
interior. This led to me seeing the teacup set again,
and I casually remarked on how much I loved it
as a kid. My grandma nodded and looked at me,
saying: ''Well you're supposed to have them anyway.''I didn't quite
understand what she meant by ''supposed to have them'', so
I asked her about it. She told me that when
I was small, like one or two years old, my
great grandma (her mother) had seen me playing with them.
Apparently, the set had been hers once upon a time,
and she told my grandma that when I was older
I could have them. Now, my great grandma died shortly
after this, so I have no memories of her. That
made it all the more special. Apparently, my grandma had
just forgotten about it until I brought it up.So, long
story short, I'm now the proud owner of a tiny,
blue tea set!

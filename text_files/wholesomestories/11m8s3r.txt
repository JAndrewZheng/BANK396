In 2009 I finished a tour in Afghanistan.  When
I got back to the states I stayed in a
small hotel in Bangor, Maine for a night where I
caught a flight to my home state the next day
to see my family.  Since I was still in
my ACU’s they bumped me to first class seating so
I was able to board first.  I took my
seat and I started falling asleep as people were piling
in and getting their luggage stowed.  People were standing
in the aisle right next to me waiting on the
people in front of them to get situated.  I
dozed off due to jet lag for probably less than
a minute when someone slammed the overhead luggage door nearby
and it startled me awake.  I didn’t freak out
but my reaction was more like when you wake up
and know that you slept through your alarm clock, like
that sudden adrenaline feeling.  I had been through my
share of mortar attacks so I guess my body was
primed to react.  The man in the aisle standing
next to me was wearing a business suit, he was
probably mid-40’s and he just had that “wholesome dad” look
about him.  He noticed my reaction and he put
his hand on my shoulder and with a small smile
he softly said, “you’re okay”. He gave my shoulder a
quick squeeze then moved a few steps forward to make
his way towards his seat.  I was 20 at
the time and I really missed my dad so it
was just nice, even just for a few seconds to
feel that fatherly reassurance.  I know it’s not the
most interesting story but I just think it’s cool witnessing
humans being decent.

So as the title says I went to my friends
house yesterday, I met up with some friends from college
yesterday and to say the least I had an extremely
fun time. We and my other friends mostly chilled in
the garden as it was a nice day, I stayed
for dinner which we also had in the garden, we
also listened to music chatting and laughing as we did
so. Nothing dramatic happened, I just had fun. Thanks for
reading!

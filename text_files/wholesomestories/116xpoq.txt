So my niece who’s 6…. Will be 7 in April
she’s had this kind of severe shyness, we think it
was somehow taught in school, she pretty much started school
with covid hit and she was taught not to mix
with other people etc.But we’re still trying to figure out
and how we can help her overcome it somehow, anyway
to the story, so it was last Christmas and every
year 23rd to be exact we have a family Christmas
party… somewhat kind of a staff Christmas party since it’s
a thing for my dad and uncles electrical business since
the business pays for the expenses, when we do this
we have a sort of separate guys party and girls
where we go separately for lunch and then join back
for party kinda like a stag/hen party then meet together
to finish it off kind of thing.. Anyway we were
having dinner just us ladies just as we were waiting
for our food to arrive my niece needed to go
to the bathroom but she was afraid to move, as
she needed to slide a few seats to one end
of the table and passing another table where 4 ladies
were sitting (the place was a bit of a small
pub) she was too shy to pass the table where
there were 4 ladies sitting since I wasn’t able to
do much myself as I was in a wheelchair due
to a bad knee injury, I couldn’t really get up
and help her but when the 4 ladies started to
notice what was going on my mum explained to these
ladies “I’m sorry girls my granddaughter is painfully shy around
people.Then my niece asked me “OP?? I don’t want them
to look at me” so I looked up to the
ladies and just said back to my niece holing the
ladies would hear “it’s okay baby they’re not looking at
you, they are just 4 lovely ladies who are enjoying
their Christmas party just like we are” and the ladies
clocked something so they all covered their eyes and said
“don’t worry we’re not looking!” Which then my niece got
up and went to the bathroom with my brothers girlfriend
then as my nice returned the ladies who were eating
dinner noticed, stopped what they were doing and covered their
eyes again so my nice can return to her seat.As
thanks I got out my wheelchair carefully made my way
to the bar and asked the bar staff to send
a bottle of Prosecco to their table… on me of
course as thanks.

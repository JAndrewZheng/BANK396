I really love my partner. He is such a kind
and gentle person. He’s so funny he makes my sides
hurt. He has helped me see hard situations in a
different way. He’s so down to earth and so grounded
in who he is. What I really love about him
is how hard-working, diligent, and open minded he is. Recently,
I experienced a lot of loss in my life (my
dog, family members, etc) and he has been nothing but
supportive towards me. He didn’t even know my aunt but
still came to her funeral viewing services to support me
and my family. He comes almost every weekend, almost a
2hr commute- just to be with me.  He has
come through with helping me in many ways. He studies
with me. He motivates me to do better in life
and he believes in me. He’s probably one of my
biggest supporters, and definitely my biggest fan. Even with his
own stressors in life, he has never failed to be
there for me. He deserves the world and more, and
I will do my best to be there for him
in all his times of need. I guess the universe
knew I would face a lot in my life during
this season, and our paths led us to each other.
I’ll always be there for him in any circumstance. I
really appreciate and love him so much. I love you
lovey. Thank you for being my rock ❤️😭.

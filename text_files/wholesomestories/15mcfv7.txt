When I was growing up, I had an absent father,
and a mother who worked so much she might as
well have been absent. Older siblings took care of me
and younger siblings but only becauaee he had no other
choice, otherwise he would have been off running about with
his friends or something, so I had to teach myself
how to cook even basic things at a young age.When
I was babysitting my friends kids, their daughter asked me
to make breakfast, but I figured it's a good teachable
moment and taught her how to make the perfect fried,
boiled and poached eggs (one of each, not one process
done after the other to the same egg of course,
lol!) And this morning she was up at 5:30 am
prepping because she wanted to make fried eggs all by
herself. ðŸ˜€ gave me a warm feeling because I got
to do something that my biological father never did for
me and it felt good.

Currently I am learning Danish for my Step-Father. My dad
has just married a Danish man and he speaks English
and French but he prefers Danish. So i have taken
it upon myself to learn Danish. He has helped me
lots and i feel itâ€™s a very nice to do.
i had previously been quite depressed and he helped me
through my depression. he could tell how lonely i was
and made it an important task to make me feel
not lonely and appreciated. so i now will learn danish.l
and surprised him ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°

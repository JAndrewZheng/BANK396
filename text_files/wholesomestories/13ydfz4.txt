For some context, I work at a bookstore, and this
happened way back in January right after the holiday season.
There was this little black boy and his mom who
came up to my register to check out. He was
getting books about Miles Morales, an iteration of Spiderman who
is black, so I made some friendly conversation, I said
I really liked Miles, I thought he was a cool
character, and I asked if he’d seen Into The Spiderverse
since Miles is the main character. He said yes, he
had seen it, and that he really liked it. At
the time, I had just recently been out to the
movies with some friends, and we saw the preview for
the new movie Across The Spiderverse, so I asked if
he knew that there was going to be a second
spiderverse movie. His mom spoke up and said that yes,
he did know! She said his birthday was going to
be right around the time the movie came out, so
they were going to take him to see it to
celebrate, and on top of all of that she said
it would be his first time ever seeing a movie
in theaters. The whole interaction just warmed my heart and
I have not stopped thinking about this kid since I
keep seeing trailers for the movie all over. Today is
the release date so happy birthday to you kid!

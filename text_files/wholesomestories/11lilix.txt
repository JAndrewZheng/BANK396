Note: I’m all for altering names in stories that happened
IRL, but this man has saved me on multiple occasions
& feel he deserves the recognition.My old school counsellor, Mr.
Breslin. He has helped me through more than anyone I
know. The day of my father’s funeral, he was working.
He left the school, came down to the church &
stood in the courtyard because there was no more room
in the building itself. We were rushed for time so
we couldn’t really hang back & say hello to everyone;
it was a case of carrying the casket into the
hearse & heading to the cemetery. But he didn’t care.
After we loaded up the hearse, I was ushered towards
the car, wiping the tears from my face, when I
felt a hand grip my shoulder. I spun around &
met the gaze of this living saint. He was the
first person to interact with me after the funeral. He
didn’t come with the school. He didn’t come on behalf
of the school. He wasn’t there as an ambassador. He
was there as a man. A man who wished to
show sympathy & care for someone he knew who had
lost someone dearly. I still remember seeing the pain in
his face as he just whispered “I’m so sorry” over
& over again. We had a strong bond before, but
after that day, I will have the utmost respect &
appreciation for that man until it’s me being carried in
a coffin.I hadn’t seen him since. Until today. He was
in the queue, and he came to my till. Casual
small talk ensued, “what you up to, how you been”,
the usual. Given the last couple years, my knee jerk
response to “how are you” is “Ahh, surviving”. I said
this & he looked at me with a smirk and
replied “well, there’s no better man to do it”. There
was an unspoken recognition there. We both knew what each
other meant. That hit me hard. That man has seen
me through some of my lowest points during my adolescence
& has walked me to the other side on more
occasions than I can remember. To hear that from him,
with the look in his eye & the inflection in
his voice, it showed belief. It showed faith. It showed
support. Despite the length of time between our last interactions,
that man’s influence has left an eternal impression on me,
and I’d like to think maybe I did the same
for him.

So this one time, me and my little brother were
eating at Freddy’s Steakburgers and my mom and little sister
were parked in the front. A Vagos member pulls up
next to my mom in a parking space and my
little sister (she’s 2) was like “Hiiii, I like your
bike!” While waving and pointing. The guy turned around and
laughed and, according to my mom said,”thanks, me too!” My
mom apologized for my sister, saying she just likes to
talk to people sometimes and the guy was chill about
it. When he walked into Freddy’s, everything went silent except
the music. I wasn’t really scared and honestly I had
no idea who the Vagos were until I looked it
up. Anyways, the teens working there were literally shaking and
stuff and when the guy went to go sit at
a table, another man literally moved two seats away. I
was gonna compliment the Vagos guy on his jacket, since
it looked super cool, but I didn’t want to bother
him. I thought it was funny how everyone was staring
at him but me and my brother ate our food
and left. So, Vagos guy if you’re out there, you’re
pretty cool :D

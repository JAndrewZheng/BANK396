I remember coming to my school for the first time
at 5-6 like any other kid i cried. There were
pretty chill kids in the class and there was like
a mat you needed to sit on i sat all
the way back where i found my friends they were
like "hi there wanna be friends" and ofcourse i said
yes. We all grew up with eachother always played with
eachother and they are the best people in that time
if there was someone new (a guy) they would do
stuff with him. Now that we are all grown up
doenst matter because we're still friends till this day.

We’ll call my man A.A and I were 17 at
the time. About a month and a half into dating,
we decided that we wanted to do the deed. Mind
you, I had grey sheets and red LED lights, so
color was not something we could really dusting. All was
good until it was over. A pulled out, and when
he looked down his expression went from happy, to slight
panic. I asked what’s wrong when I sat up and
there was a small dark spot on my sheets. We
thought the condom had a hole and was leaking. That
is until I turned my regular lights on and the
spot was red. I had started my period in the
middle of my first time having sex with him. I
was completely petrified. Almost on the verge of tears out
of embarrassment. I thought he was gonna think it was
disgusting. However, he immediately went into comforting me. Telling me
it was ok and that we would just wash up
and change the sheets. He tossed me one of my
black bath towels to sit on and went to start
the shower. I told him to go ahead and shower
first to get any blood off of him and I
would wait. He said “we could just get in together”
so we did. After he washed up, he told me
to go ahead and relax in the warm shower for
a bit until I was ready to get out and
then we could change the sheets and go about the
rest of our night. I asked him to just leave
everything be and that I would take care of it
so he didn’t have to, to which he said “ok.”
When I got out of the shower, I found my
room completely clean, the sheets changed, the old sheets in
the washer, snacks, drinks, and a movie ready to play.
He took care of it all so I wouldn’t have
to worry about it. 3 years later and A and
I are recently married❤️

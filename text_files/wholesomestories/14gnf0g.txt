I was working today with my coworker. He’s very friendly
and we both make a great team at work. Today
was very busy. Lots of costumers and lots of work
to do behind the scenes. He was taking a lot
of the costumers and I was doing work in the
back. When the costumers cleared in the front he seemed
to notice how overwhelmed I was getting from the work
in the back. I started speaking to myself about what
I had to do and the order in which I
would do it. I looked at the mess in the
workstation and said, “I just don’t even know where to
start” a costumer then walks in and I offer to
take them. After about 20 minutes the costumer leaves and
I return to the back where I find half the
work completed and a fairly clean workstation. Another costumer walks
in and my coworker goes to help them. I stood
there for a second processing. My coworker heard I was
stressed about something and on his time to relax he
did the work for me? Not only that but I
was able to complete the work faster because I messy
working environment makes me very anxious and overwhelmed but because
he had got it to be less claustrophobic I was
able to feel more relaxed and complete the rest of
the work. I of course thanked my coworker a million
times. I don’t think he realized how much his act
of kindness meant to me. It was like such a
huge weight was off my shoulders. Seriously the most wholesome
moment I’ve ever had

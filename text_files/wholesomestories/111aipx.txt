apologies for my grammar, English isn't my first language, and
i have Dyslexia.If it matters, I'm 19, non-binary using the
they/them pronounsAnyway, the wholesome story!I had plans to go shopping
for my parents to get them some Valentine gifts. Was
on my way to the last store when I saw
a little child standing still with no parent in sight,
I slowed down and looked around if I could see
the mom, the mom called for the child but it
didn't seem like the child wanted to come along, so
I kneeled down a bit to become on eye level
of the child and held out my hand while saying
"let's go back to momma". The child looked a bit
curious at me and then my headset, I understand why
since I have horns and a crown attachments to my
headset. ([Picture attached](https://www.pixenli.com/image/VHeRpqLP) for those who are curious to see
the headset attachments)I let the child take my hand on
their own,  and we walked together to the mom.
Which I could see her say something in the form
of "thank you" but I personally didn't hear it because
I had my music on but I replied with "My
pleasure" (in my own language I said "alstublieft") and I
went on my way after waving bye to the child.I
know it was a short story,  but that little
moment warmed up my da,  and I will not
forget it. And i hope it also brought a smile
on you guy's face. I always say the small gestures
are most appreciated.

So this is kind of a short story but anyway
  A good few years ago before I went
to school my teacher's class went on a school trip
and only one of her students couldn't afford the trip
(his family wasn't doing to good on money) so she
snuck him on the bus and paid for him she
was  in quite big trouble but she explained it
to the principal and she got off the hook 
tldr: my teacher paid for one of her students trips

A while back I was on a flight with my
family, it was a 5 hour long flight so me
and my little sister (we were both quite little at
the time) were playing the games provided by the airline.
Of the games that were available, my little sister spent
a lot of time playing Tic-Tac-Toe (she wasnt able to
play more complex games at the time) . The game
was able to be played with anyone else on the
flight.Towards the end of the flight, my little sister was
very tired (it was rather late at night) and started
playing against a random person on the plane. We'll call
this guy Tim (that isnt his real name). So Tim
and my little sister are playing tic-tac-toe and she is
actually *winning.* Of course, my mother was somewhat confused on
why my little sister- who has the relative cognitive ability
of a malfunctioning microwave- was winning (i think we were
the only kids on the flight).So cut to the end
of the flight where everyone is taking their things and
heading to the airport. So we glance behind our seats
and there is a middle aged gentleman sat behind us.
That man- who introduces himself as Tim (not his real
name), informs us that HE was the one playing tic-tac-toe
with my little sister. Turns out Tim was glancing at
her board and purposely letting her win so she would
be happy. Tim tells us he has daughters back home
and is just trying to make a little girl's day.

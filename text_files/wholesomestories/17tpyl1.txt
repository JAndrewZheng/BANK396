My hair has been falling out and I have been
wearing wigs part-time. I went wigless on date night with
my fiancé over the forecast. Rain was predicted so I
said screw a wig. Naturally, I was feeling kind of
insecure all day. When, after lunch and a stroll around
the mall, we're walking over to the movie theater for
a movie and we see a little girl and her
mom. And the little girl exclaims, "Look mommy! She's so
pretty!" I was so taken aback! I just...losing my hair
and having made the choice to cut it short I've
felt anything but and all I could do was smile
at her and her mom.They smiled and waved back and
then I was all my smiles. My fiancé was all:
She's right, you are pretty.And I just couldn't help but
keep smiling. Losing my hair has been such a struggle
but maybe just maybe it isn't all bad.

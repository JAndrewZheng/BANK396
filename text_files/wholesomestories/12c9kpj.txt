Hi Reddit. I'm in a silly goofy mood as my(23f)
husband(25m) and I are quickly approaching eight years together. I
just wanted to share a pretty wholesome moment we had
together in the middle of a Bob Evans right before
closing time, when we first moved in together in 2018.
I'll just say I have issues with food. I'm a
texture taster, and due to some trauma sometimes it's very
hard for me to eat. I often get one thing
from each restaurant, seldom do I ever change it up.
My husband(at the time fiance) caught onto this early on,
and would ask questions about why I don't eat certain
things despite liking the flavor(pickles, some melons, some other vegetables),
and I explained to him that I have texture issues.
Now any time I say "I like the taste i-"
he finishes with "just don't like the texture, gotcha," he's
very sweet. Anyway we are in the middle of a
Bob Evan's right near closing time because neither of us
have eaten, and both of us were fresh off of
work at the nursing home. The waitress offers me apple
butter, which I LOVE. I get the apple butter, and
I Starr earing my toast. My husband looks at me
very confused and really worried and says," did you not
like your food? Is it not made right?" I was
confused as to why he'd ask that, so I questioned
why and he said. "Because you always eat your eggs
first, then your bacon, then your hash browns, then your
toast, you've never done anything else,". When I tell you
I almost CRIED. I felt so..seen? Like someone truly, truly
knew me for the first time in my life? Now
he knows all my orders and exactly how I like
them and the order in which I eat everything. I
love this man to death and I hope we are
together in the next life as well ❤️

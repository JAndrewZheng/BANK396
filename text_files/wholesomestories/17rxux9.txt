My husbands grandmother LOVES cheetos.She lived alone for the last
decade since her husband paed. Her memory had been declining
but was a very sharp woman, nonetheless.For Halloween she'd buy
boxes of chips for the kids and would pick the
bags of cheetos out of the box for herself.They were
her favorite snack. She always had some cheetos on hand
in full view too, which the family knew about. She
had recently become ill and when she was in the
hospital she couldn't say much, but when my cousin joked
about having some of her cheetos she said, "don't... Dare..."
we laughed as she cracked jokes even on her death
bed. She paed away last week, and we've reconnected with
family in the meantime to be close during the funeral.
She wanted to incorporate cheetos in her funeral somehow. So
the family decided to make flower arrangements with cheetos in
them. When we came to her house, our family had
been sorting through her possessions. As we looked through different
drawers, cupboards and other places in the house, we kept
finding small bags of cheetos scattered among her possessions. We
were perplexed. The current theory is that in order to
keep from eating too many at once she would hide
them from herself in little places to forget about so
that as she went about her daily life she would
stumble upon a bag she'd forgetten as a little treat!As
a way to send her off right, we're burying her
tomorrow with a bag of cheetos. :)

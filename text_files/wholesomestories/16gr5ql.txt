I am laying in bed and just remembered a story
from my EARLY childhood. So early I’m not sure how
much of it is accurate but it is a story
that has been repeated multiple times and every time I
remember it I have to smile. And now I hope
it can make all of you smile.When I was a
very little girl my family (my mom, dad, sister, grandma,
grandpa, and myself) all went on a trip to Disney
together. My grandfather is a generally reserved man who would
rather stick to watching his sports rather than interacting with
his grandchildren. (Think old man from Disney’s UP) And this
story is really his story. One morning of our trip
we went to a western themed restaurant called the whispering
canyon, ironically named because it was anything but quiet, and
nobody whispered. One of their quirky little things was that
not every table had ketchup at it. There simply wasn’t
enough for every table. We witnessed as our neighboring table
asked for a bottle of ketchup. The results? The server
for them stood up on the chair and yelled “ketchup!
Everybody pass the ketchup” and all tables who had ketchup
brought their bottles over to their table, quite literally covering
their table, to everyone’s amusement. My grandfather, being the self
conscious and reserved person he was didn’t want that kind
of attention. So he decided the next best thing was
to take a bottle of ketchup from the table next
to us. Unluckily for him, he was caught red handed
by a server, who proceeded to thoroughly embarrass him anyways.
Our server stood up on a chair and yelled loud
as she could “attention everyone!This man stole a bottle of
ketchup!” Pointing at my grandfather, “everyone repeat after me **hey
mister**” (everyone repeats) “**set a better example for your grandchildren**”
Our grandfather was mortified. Not only had he been caught
but lectured by the whole restaurant. I’m not sure if
the restaurant is even there anymore but this story will
never fade away.

I've been growing out my hair, shave my head and
giving it to a children's cancer center. I know it
makes the kids day and just getting that letter and
picture makes me feel amazing. I love doing that. I've
been doing this since I got adopted. I've been wanting
to do this my whole life though. I just shaved
my head about a year ago and I'm doing it
again. I'm so happy I did it.

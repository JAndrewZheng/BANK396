When I was about 12 or 13, I got rejected
by my crush at my school dance. My friends did
absolutely nothing to help me feel better. My dad died
in war and my mom was in the hospital. When
my brother heard about this, he took the first flight
back from Australia (he was going there with one of
his friend's older brothers) and came to America with all
his Australian friends. When he and his friends met up
with me, they said that my brother had spoke with
my mom and she said that my crush didn't deserve
me and that I would be better off without him.
They also said that my dad would be proud of
me, no matter what. I cried so hard that day.
I love you, guys.

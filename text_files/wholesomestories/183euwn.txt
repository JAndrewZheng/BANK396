 I had the most random conversation with my brotherSo
he called Funtime foxy a he in his sentence and
when I spoke my sentence and called Funtime foxy a
her (Funtime foxy goes by She/he in the games) and
he was like "I'm pretty sure Funtime foxy is a
boy" and I told him that they use both he
and she in the games and yk what broski does
"Oh that makes sense because the pink and white." why
can't everyone be that understanding ðŸ˜­âœ‹

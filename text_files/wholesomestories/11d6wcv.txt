So, for context, im 18 and I don't know how
to cross a road properly yet.I never got to learn.So
for the past 4 years that I've gone home on
my own, my friends help me cross the mainroad in
front of my school and another one further down then
I book a cab at the next crossing so I
can save money. [To buy gifts for them on special
occasions, but they don't know this reason]But today the friends
had a lot of work so left early. They weren't
with me and I didn't have enough money in my
wallet. I went to the crossing and stood there for
a bit not knowing what to do and thinking I'd
just use all the money I had and book a
cab home then get my grandpapa to pay and I'd
pay him back later, I only had online payment but
it was not usually used as the cabs preferred cash.But
then I got this lil boost of idk what and
I did it.I crossed the street.Walked right across like a
damn chicken. [I did look before crossing though-]Picked a rental
bike from that side [payed online] and drove home. [Saved
me 20 bucks]I just got home and texted the two
friends who keep me alive on the road.They had the
best reactions qwq[Up on my page rn]

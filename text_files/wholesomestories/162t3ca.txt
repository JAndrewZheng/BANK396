I (14f) just went on my first date with a
guy I’ve known for 2 years. We met ironically through
our friends that were dating (Ironic because we are now
dating). We’d become close friends and told each other everything.
Maybe a month ago he asked me out and we
finally went. We went to a cafe and went mini
golfing. At the end of the date my mom picked
me up, we hugged and he said. “Remember if you’re
ever upset I’m one call away.” I was so happy
I was blushing. Then we hugged again and I left.
I get home and my parents had told all my
neighbors about the date and they ALL wanted to know
if we were dating so I asked him and he
said ”say yes.” And that’s the story of me and
my boyfriend.

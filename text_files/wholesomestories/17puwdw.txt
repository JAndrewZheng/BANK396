there was this one time I was crying and It
was in this playground not too far from my house.
I kept on crying and I couldn't stop and then
someone tapped my shoulder and when I turned around it
was. little girl. she gave me a Coca-Cola and I
saw her father from the window screaming ´Don't cry´ ´You
are a beautiful person don't cry´ and she gave me
a hug. I wiped my tears and I went home.
I will never forget that day and every time I
think about it, I smile.

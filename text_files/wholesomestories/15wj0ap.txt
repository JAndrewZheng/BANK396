I know I’ve posted here before but this is a
new wholesome story I think needs to be shared. So
about a week ago me and my best friend were
talking. I was very stressed out and sometimes I fall
into the terrible habit of just saying the first thing
on my mind.  I promise myself to think before
I speak but I definitely do slip up. I ended
up saying something mean to my friend that came out
of nowhere to be honest. I immediately realized what I
have done and I am fully aware that I was
a major ah in this situation. She kind of looked
at me in shock. Obviously once I realized what I
said I felt terrible. I went to apologize to her
and instead started balling my eyes out. Instead of yelling
at me or being mad at me she just hugged
me and said she forgives me. After I pulled myself
together I apologized first for crying and acting like I
was the victim in the situation then ofc I apologized
for what I said and how I made her feel.
She told me she already forgave me. I love her
so much. Honestly she is the most genuine sweetest person
I know. Even when she had every right to be
angry with me she chose to comfort me. I am
so lucky to have her in my life

When I was young, probably around 5th grade or 6th
grade, I remember I was biking down the streets using
my friend’s bike since we switched bikes for like a
few blocks for fun.I vividly remember losing control of the
bike I was riding and ended up falling off it
and injuring myself. However after like, a minute or 2
of just staying on the ground as my friends worried,
I remember a lady from the other side of the
road just running through the road (there were no cars
at the time luckily) and just helping me up and
bringing me into the cafe she worked at to help
me bandage my injuries up.I tried to pay for her
help, but she refused and said if I wanted to
pay for her help then I should just order a
drink or something, and so i decided to buy a
drink.I just remembered this story and I decided why not
post it to Reddit for people to see.I don’t know
if it’s really wholesome, but it made me smile remembering
it so I think it’s wholesome.(Sorry for bad English)

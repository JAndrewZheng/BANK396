So this is funny but very wholesomely sweet at the
same time. So a couple days ago I traveled back
to my hometown with my mom for a visit and
met w my grandma. We were all walking to a
nearby resto in town after coming back from an errand
when I see this little girl in a scout uniform
(prolly about 4-6yo) and she had her hands full with
a paper bag from a fast food. She didnt have
anyone with her (or maybe had someone with her closely
behind). I thought it was cute and that maybe she
was just carrying her lunch but she sees this homeless
old man at the sidewalk seemingly asleep whilst sitting. She
approaches him and sets the paper bag of food next
to him but he didnt notice her at all. She
kinda just kindly put the bag next to him and
went back the opposite direction and she hadn't informed him
in any way and i just thought that was funnyðŸ˜‚
But good deeds are good deeds I suppose and I
feel like this is still a great learning opportunity for
kids to be kind to anyone especially the less fortunate.
10/10 for brownie points for you wee girlðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶ðŸ’•

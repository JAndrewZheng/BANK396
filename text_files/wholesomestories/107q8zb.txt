This is a heartwarming, real story that my family likes
to retell when times are rough and I thought I'd
share it with you all:So, before my dad was married
to my mom, he was in a previous marriage to
another woman who was honestly evil incarnate. Together they had
my step-sister who was severely handicapped. She was confined to
a wheelchair, could not speak, and she had to have
everything done for her including being bathed and having her
diaper changed. Since my dad's ex was a very terrible,
abusive person, he eventually divorced her and got full custody
of their children. For years, he would take care of
my sister and sing to her "Every Rose Has It's
Thorn" by Poison and she would giggle with joy every
time he did. It was their song. He took care
of her and sung to her everyday until she was
15 years old when she passed away. I was only
2 at the time so I don't have any defining
memories with her, just pictures. During the funeral, it rained
hard but when my dad got in the car to
head to the cemetery to bury her, a rainbow came
out from behind the clouds; the brightest he'd ever seen.
And he heard the DJ say on the radio, "This
song is from a little girl to her daddy letting
him know everything is going to be alright." Guess what
song came on? "Every Rose Has It's Thorn" by Poison.
Now, we've asked many family members if they called in
to request the song but no one owned up to
it. My father truly believes it was his little girl
telling him that she was okay wherever she was.

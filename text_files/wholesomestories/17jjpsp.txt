I was always the weird kid at school. Never really
liked, never really hung out with. Then I met my
friend(lets call her Blair to respect privacy. no name used
is their real name.), Blair. We were friends, until first
grade. She then started to pick on me, with a
group of kids, called Mason and Jessica(again, not real names.).
We were kinda-friends, until she left. Second grade, I was
alone again. Third grade, I met Marie. She was nice,
and introduced me to Mike. We were friends, until a
fight over a stupid pen separated us.Fourth grade was nice.
I didn't have to be friends with anyone, and I
got my now cat, Catniss. Fifth grade was when I
was hit hard in life though.I met Tara, and they
introduced me to Claire. We were friends, until i was
friends with Mike again and met Sarah through him. I
was at fault for this, because I scared them away.
I then met Lily and Miriam, who were my sorta-friends.
Going through friends always leaving me, I've developed Trust and
Abandonment issues.And while most say middle school was the worst
years of their lives, they were my best.On October 14th,
I saw someone dressed up as a character from a
game I knew. I ran up to them and said
their name, and they laughed, talking about how so many
people came up and said that.We then sat together every
day.When we were separated by lunches, I met Jax, Alex,
and Kelly.And on May 8th, 2024, that same person i
met in the cafeteria will approach our 1st anniversary as
Genderfae Girlfriend and Non-Binary Partner.

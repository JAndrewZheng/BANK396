My grandma, Esperanza(Hope), died three years ago and when that
happened I was in the process of moving to my
new place, about a month after that a bush cricket
(also known as an Esperanza) stood on my front door
for one or two weeks and then it vanished. Now
is three years later and I just moved to a
new place and guess what? Another Esperanza was waiting for
me at my new front door. I’d like to think
this is my grandmother, letting me know she’s here.

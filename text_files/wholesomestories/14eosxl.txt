So for backstory context, growing up everytime we got sweets
that were fruit flavoured me and my brother began to
realise our mum only took the orange ones. So from
that moment everytime we had a packet of sweets like
fruit pastilles we would leave our mum all the orange
ones. This has been a thing all the way into
adulthood. No exceptions. Nobody has had the bravery to try
an orange one for years.Cut to current day. I’m nearing
to my medical school final and the stress is peaking.
I came home to be with the family before exams
and at one moment me and my mum were hugging
and talking about my exams. Being the adult I am
I obviously asked only childish questions haha, I asked if
she would still love me if I failed all my
medical finals. She replied that there is nearly nothing on
this earth that could make her stop loving me. I
took a minute to think. I asked what if I
began to love orange fruit pastilles the most…. Silence fell.
She confirmed this is one of the few things in
the world that would break that love.Thankfully I don’t like
orange fruit pastilles. First post so sorry if this wrong
or cheesy haha

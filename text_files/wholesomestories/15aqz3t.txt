       To start this
little story I’m just going to give an insight on
what happened today before we get to the cute stuff.
Me and my sister share and Spotify account. This wouldn’t
be the first time she has held logging me out
of her account over my head during fights. However, this
time she actually logged me out and hasn’t let me
back into it. This honestly hurt a lot and just
added on the tears that I was already shedding about
the whole fight (she ended up getting pretty much the
whole family involved). I was crying a lot so I
texted my boyfriend to see if he could come over
because I just needed some love. Usually, I always play
music in the car from the Spotify account, but clearly
I couldn’t. When I picked my boyfriend up from his
house I asked him to please play music from his
phone. I noticed songs that I like and play often
(also wayyyy out of his music taste) being played. I
asked him if he had my playlist or something, but
he told me something much better. He told me “when
you play songs often or post them on your Snapchat
story, I always save them to my playlist.” It’s so
little but it honestly made my day so much better.
When we finally got back to my house he hugged
me and let my cry. Now it’s 10:44 pm and
I’m going to bed in a happy mood. I love
this boy so much 😊

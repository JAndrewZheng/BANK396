A friend of mine i met a few weeks at
work. The first time I met her I was complimenting
her makeup and the mom told me she’s nonverbal. I
told her I get it as I’m autistic and had
seizures and my friend was clearly happy as she is
too. She gave me her number and i said it
was awesome meeting her. She said thank you for being
nice.My jaw felt to the ground and so did her
mothers. The mom was about to cry as she never
heard her speak in a full sentence before. She texted
me later thanking me for not treating her like she’s
two and happy to near me and someone to relate
too.Her and i both are excited as we are going
out for breakfast tomorrow and a movie merithon. If you
magically find this thank you Rachel for being so awesome,
kind and funny and not letting it stop you.

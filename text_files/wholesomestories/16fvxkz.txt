Hi I'm kinda new to reddit so if I'm doing
something wrong, please tell me!There's this girl in my school
who is absolutely awesome! She cares for the environment, helps
people, she's never been mean or discriminating and is just
genuinely the nicest person ever. So one day I went
to the bathroom during class and I (do my buissnes
and then) come out of the stall and I just
see her pull up her shirt and there's friggin belt
marks all over her belly. She just breaks down in
tears and I just kinda stand there... she eventually sees
me and I just walk over and give her a
hug and tell her that I think she's an amazing
person she is. The person in the other occupied stall
comes out and sees everything and imidiatly understands what's happening
and we have this like minute long silent group hug!
This was a couple years ago and we're still friends
even though they're now seniors and i'm a freshman (this
happend in middle school). Anyways happy senior year!

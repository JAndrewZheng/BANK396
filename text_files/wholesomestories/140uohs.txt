I (18 M) worked at a grocery store in my
small town in a nice small town that has about
4,000 people, so sometimes people knew each other or didnt
at all, a nice community. I was working a closing
shift, two ladies, a mother about her 40 or 50s
and her daughter in her late 20’s came in my
line with a giant cart or two, and explained they
got a new insurance card that was loaded with money,
about $150 on each card and they would try to
buy as much as they needed and put back what
they couldn’t. I had nice simple talk with them about
the day and soon we tried ringing their card, nothing,
we tried every way we could to scan their cards,
I even called people from the customer service and they
couldnt figure it out either. Both ladies looked like they
were ready to cry and they only had $60 in
cash and it was over $450 dollars in total. Right
as i was about to clear the transaction, all of
us defeated, a elderly gentleman who was in the next
line over and leaving saw the ladies and offered to
pay. At first they didn’t accept but they gave in
after he said it was fine, and he payed in
full for their groceries and refused the money they offered
for a thank you and he left. Later I found
out from my coworker who had checked out with him
also paided for some else’s groceries that was $30 or
so. That night I felt grateful for my community and
how the people stick out for others even if they
dont know one another.

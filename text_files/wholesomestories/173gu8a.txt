He is our town's cat man who lives in a
trailer and smokes a lot of weed. The cats who
can't take care of their kittens or want some help
with it, bring them to him. He feeds them, cares
for them, socializes them and then adopts them out. He
is always surrounded by cats and kittens. If you want
a kitten you go to his trailer and ask to
adopt one. He doesn't charge anything he just talks to
you for a bit to make sure you'll love the
animal and take care of it. He's surrounded by books
and video cassettes and always wears a big housecoat. He's
full of stories and will talk to you about cats,
politics, music, movies, games, weed, whatever it is. The trailer
is cold and unlocked with a hole in the front
door for the cats to come in and out. He
always has them though. They know to go to him.
I came to him today for a kitten because my
foster kid is having a rough time. We are "borrowing"
a kitten until he feels better but I suspect the
kitten will stay. We've named them Pizza Crust. Gender is
unknown. Knowing the gender isn't the cat man's job. He
was happy to 'lend' Pizza Crust to us for as
long as we need them. I mean of course he
was happy to lend a kitten to help a child.
So yeah, that's our cat man. He's the goat.

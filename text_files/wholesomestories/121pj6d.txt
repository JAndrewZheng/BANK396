first I wanna say English is not my first language.
this story may seem weird but it is really sweet.
so this story is from when I was ten Yes
I know I'm early and that is just how my
body develops. so it was on my summer vacation in
France with my mom my dad and my sister. we
were staying at a place that my aunt owned with
her family it is a kind of place with apartments
for people so yeah there were more people. the night
I find out we were having a big barbecue party
and there were a lot of people and friends and
family. well, my aunt has a son that is 2
years older than I. he and I became close. so
the night was fun laughing playing all kinds of games
really good food and just overall nice. so when it
was around 11 pm I was going to bed and
I go to the toilet and saw blood I thought
with my naive brain that I had a bladder infection
because I had two before and it blooded both times
so I thought why not but it was just a
lot of blood so I go downstairs and call my
mom but she does not reply and my dad was
not there so I go to my sister and say
it she sees me and then try to call my
mom but she does not react. only when I say
her name fully like in middle names and surname then
she react she goes direct to my aunt and fixes
some pads and some painkillers. I go to bed try
to sleep the next day the weather was gray and
that was weird because the whole vacation it was sunny
 so my mom and my sister and I go
shopping for a necklace as a tradition that is when
it is your first period you get a yewelery and
my sister jus get one. now when i get home
i'm a little kranky and tired and just overal in
pain my cusin try his best to make me happy
but I don't know why he wants to play every
game I like and i become a little bit restles
i become angry because he just don't go he wants
me constant with him. so i snap. and I asked
what are you doing and he says I know it
is your period and I just try to make you
happy i almost cried you know emotional. so he heard
that i was telling my sister that I had my
period and he promised my he keep it a secret.
so this is my story it is just sweet and
it shows how nice my cusin is and how sweet
it was to just make me happy. I have more
sweet story's about him but this was my most vivid
memory.  so yeah his name is loui and is
now 18 and i'm 16 and that is just honestly
the most cutest annoying thing that someone ever did for
me.

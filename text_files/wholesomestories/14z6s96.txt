I have no one to tell this to that will
care or will actually listen. I work as an inspector
of sorts, I go to peoples homes and inspect a
certain aspect of them, so they can get them fixed.
Today I went to a home of an older couple,
they were probably in their late 60's, early 70's. They
had disney memorabilia everywhere.  Stuffed mickeys, photos of themselves,
pictures of Walt Disney, souvenirs. I said to the husband,
"Your home is so cute, I love all the Disney."
I did like it, but mostly I try to create
some sort of conversation between clients. I wasn't expecting the
husband to tell me the story of why Disney was
so important to them, he said that 30 years ago
he took Beth to Disney and it was her first
time there. He said they went in front of Cinderellas
castle and he had a box with a ring surrounded
by petals in another box presented to her by someone
who worked there and he got on one knee with
Mickey next to him and proposed to his Beth and
they've been inseparable since. It was the sweetest story and
the way he still looked as his Beth with a
soft smile on his face made me just want to
sob. I was so happy for them but i felt
a deep sadness within me because i don't think that
anything even remotely close will ever happen to me. I
can't stop thinking about his smile and the love I
saw in such a small exchange.

This happened in the middle or junior year. For co
text I was the sickest I've ever been but was
forced to go to school due to how my school
worked. I arrived to class and I looked terrible I
sat down and just tried to sleep my teacher and
everybody else was cool while these 2 people kept on
making fun of me for being sick. I didn't pay
much mind to them but my friend right behind me
was infuriated because I couldn't control that I was sick.
So he stood up for me and told them to
stop picking on me for being sick. I still remember
that day and he's still my friend to this day.

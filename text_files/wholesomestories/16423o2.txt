Today I’ve had the worst day. Today when I got
home from school my mom was already angrily waiting for
me in the car. Waiting to start another fight the
second I step into the car. Today my dad screamed
and cussed so loud it made my ears ring. Today
I cried more than I have in a long time.
But today my boyfriend called me while I struggled not
to harm myself. He helped me do my homework (the
reason for the fight with my parents). Today he texted
my mom and said he “needed to stop by and
drop something off”. And today, in a couple more hours
from right now, he’s going to bring me my favorite
food, some kind of gift that’s a surprise, his hoodie,
a warm hug, a long kiss, and an “I love
you so much, it’s going to be ok”. No matter
how much I hurt, how much I cry, how much
I get angry, he’ll always be by my side. I
can’t wait to marry this boy.

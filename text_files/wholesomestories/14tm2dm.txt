When I was 16 years old, I was diagnosed with
dexpression. My dad was unalived and my mom had serious
health issues. My brother was traveling around the world, so
I barely saw them, my grandma died only a week
before, and my oldest cat had paed away. I thought
that I should no longer go on. I decided that
I wanted to drive to a bridge so that I
could end it all. I parked my car about a
minute away from the bridge, and then started to walk
toward it. There just so happened to be a police
officer cleaning up a bit of litter of the side
of the bridge, and he asked me what was wrong.
I decided to tell him everything. About all the deaths
and sadness I had gone through the last couple months/years.
He talked it out with me and was super nice.
He gave me a hug and offered me therapy. I
was snapped back to reality because of him. I don't
remember his name, but I just want to owe my
life to him.

I was out shopping today with my boyfriend. Finally getting
out for a change and decided to stop in to
the local Spirit Halloween store to do a little shopping.
I haven’t been feeling very into the Halloween sport even
though it’s my favorite holiday. My boyfriend picked out a
few things, even a costume for my dog. She’s not
going to be too happy when we put it on
but she will look cute! She girl that rang up
the purchase was very nice and told me I looked
like Lily Rabe from American Horror Story. I don’t get
to watch tv too much, for various reasons. So I
wasn’t sure who she was referring to. She explained that
she’s on American Horror Story and plays a lot of
characters. She thinks she’s pretty pretty and said that she
thinks I’m really pretty. I didn’t know how to react
and got a little red faced. I managed to say
thank you. I’m not used to getting compliments and that
really meant the world to me. Especially when I was
feeling so down and unable to enjoy my favorite holiday.
I was so surprised I wasn’t able to compliment her
back. I loved the way she looked, her makeup was
amazing, and she is beautiful too. She has the look
I always wanted but never could achieve. I hopeI see
her again to be able to compliment her back someday.
It really meant a lot to me.

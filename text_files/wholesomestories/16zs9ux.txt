When I was turning ten we went to my favorite
Mexican restaurant and my mom mentioned something about it being
my birthday, they asked for my name and left, there
was a band playing in the other room, and when
a song ended one of the waiters put a fun
hat on my head and the band started singing happy
birthday to me:) great memories

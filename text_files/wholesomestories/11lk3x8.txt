When I was very little (probably 3 or 4) my
father and I were walking home and ended up paing
by a wedding reception. We saw that they were serving
wedding cake, and I told my father I wanted cake.
My father then without shame or embarrament took me inside
the reception of this couple that we did not know
to ask if we could have cake. And we did
ended up getting some. Now I'm 30 and wonder if
he still remembers those moments that make me grateful for
having him as my dad.

My sister and I are in college, we were working
on our  aignments and I'm a procrastinator wasting my
time when I saw her struggling with her work. She
needed some help with her presentation and I went in
and helped her with content, trasitions etc and it turned
out pretty well. She thanked me and the next day
I see my whole team report completed.. it was the
biggest task I had in my aignment and the least
I was looking forward to, but it was all completed.
Turns out my sister stayed up at night to research
for my aignment and go through all the trouble to
repay me. I mean, she didn't have to but I'm
grateful. What do I do for her now?? Lol

Story time, for no reason. This was 2 years ago.My
wife hemorrhaged and caused a ruckus. This was our 5th
child. The rest of the labors were cake but suddenly
I thought she was going to die on me. For
10 minutes or so, I was raging in my skull,
adrenaline blasting, and all I could do was stand there
and watch thenurses and doctors. But she's a champ, out
comes the kid and they stabilized her. Back to reality.
She's wiped out, I have a hollow eyed stare so
the nurses assure me I can lay down. So I
did. I laid down and went to sleep while they
hosed off the baby and got the wife cleaned up.
And then, as peace finally fell and it was very
silent, baby calm, wife safe, staff proud of a hard
job done very well, I farted obnoxiously in my sleep
and embarassed everyone in the room.True story.

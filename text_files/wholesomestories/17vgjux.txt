I've always thought a lot of things were impossible, and
singing in tune was one of them.But the more I
sing the more I realize that one day I'll be
able to sing songs perfectly and become a very good
singer.Singing gives me so much self love and confidence because
I've always felt bad about the fact I have a
high pitched voice, but being a tenor is a true
gift when it comes to singing.It makes me realize it's
just a question of time before I can become whoever
I want to be.I have not yet sung in front
of anyone, as I'm shy about it and I want
a professional singer's feedback before singing in front of an
audience.One day someone told me I should probably sing because
he thought my American accent was impeccable.And actually this little
remark had me thinking a lot about my capacities.It's all
about confidence and paion.I've always been paionate about language learning,
music and everything.I really wanted to share this with you,
because I don't think I've ever been gifted, my only
gift was being curious, obsessed and paionate about what I
do.Believe in your dreams! :)

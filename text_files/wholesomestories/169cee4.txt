To me,everyone is gorgeous in some way,and I love giving
people complements,the other day I was in the market with
my father,I was putting our stuff in the bags and
then I see a extremely tall man,Very Strong build,wearing all
black with a serious face,he stopped right next to me,I
look over to him and notice his nails were painted
with a pink nail polish with glitter,without any hesitation I
look up at Him and say "I love your nails!"
And he answered "Thank You so much" with the biggest,cutest
Smile i've ever seen. Theres nothing that I love more
than seeing the person smile after I complement something about
them,its an amazing feeling knowing that I made someone smile.

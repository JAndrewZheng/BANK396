When I was a kid, I once played a board
game with the neighbors kid. I was close to losing,
so I pulled the oldest trick in the world and
said that there was a monkey behind her, to exchange
our playing figures. As I was getting to the end,
I was feeling really bad, so I pulled the trick
again and changed our figures again. She was surprised both
times but didn't bother when she won. She was so
happy and it made me happy to see her happy.

Hello people. Today was the day that I (16m) and
my date went out to watch the flash that had
just recently came out, it was my first date with
the girl I liked a lot and it took time
to build up the courage so I can ask her
out, she liked me back as well and accepted my
proposal to a date. At 8:40pm we picked her up
from her house we took her to the theaters and
we watched the new flash movie that came out and
I am a huge fan of the flash and my
date also liked him as well. For a first date
it went as it typically would, greet each other and
introduce her to my brothers and SIL and oh my
god they liked her as she was very sweet and
nice to them and we all talked for a bit
until we arrived at the theater and paid for our
tickets. When we got our snacks and seats she immediately
took my hand and sat down next to me and
later on during the movie we put up the recliners
on the chairs and we snuggled up to each other
and oh my god was I happy with her. For
some context I am a 5’9 boy with shoes on
I am 5’10 and she is a 5’4 girl and
she was very hesitant to hold my hand as she
was shy, I noticed her signal and I took her
hand as we walked inside the theater. And that’s when
it happened, I saw love and what it was like
to experience it as she was so beautiful and we
both were happy so close to each other and after
the movie ended we took her to her home but
me never being in a date or having a real
girlfriend led me to being an idiot. I was supposed
to walk her home but me being as dumb as
I am I waved goodbye as I watched her enter
her house. She then proceeds to text me “I am
glad you didn’t walk me inside as it would be
cheesy” and i was so happy to read that text
and I’m glad my brother took me to go out
to my first date (for buildup you should ready my
last post here on r/wholesomestories)

My cousin surprised by flying down to my state since
she knew I missed hanging out with her as she
lives across the country from me. Her and i wanted
to get massages while she was her but most places
were booked a month out except this one place. My
cousin is blind, autistic and has anxiety when people don’t
tell her what’s going on like the doctors, dentist and
etc. I called the place asking if they could do
two people at once and I explained why I was
asking. The guy said they don’t but told me they
will more than gladly make an acception for us for
us and we’re so kind and understanding. They even said
they will make sure the person doing her will explain
what they are going to do and other things so
she felt comfortable. Thank you so much massage envy in
canton for being so kind and amazing!

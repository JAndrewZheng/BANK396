I’m an American in Japan and my boyfriend is Japanese.
My parents decided to come visit me and my boyfriend
for Christmas and together we plan to go on a
short trip. However, my boyfriend and his family don’t speak
much English while my parents don’t speak much Japanese, so
my parents decided to study Japanese while my boyfriend studied
a little English so they could meet in the middle.
Today my mom called because she was excited to tell
me all she learned and she asked us:“彼氏は美味しいですか？”“Kareshi ha oishiidesuka?”Which
translates to “Is your boyfriend delicious?” When we laughed she
immediately fixed it and changed 美味しい/oishii (delicious) to 優しい/yasashi (friendly),
but we were already all laughing so hard. I can’t
help but feel like the most lucky person in the
world because both my boyfriend and my parents love me
so much they’re willing to learn a foreign languages (and
incredibly difficult ones at that) so that they can communicate
with the other half of my life. 🥹

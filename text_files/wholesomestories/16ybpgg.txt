TW: Suicide2 years ago I was a National champion gymnast
on the U.S. Men's Junior National team and planning to
try out for the Olympics in a year. I was
considered to be one of the best young gymnasts in
the world. 1 year and 5 months ago I fractured
my spine doing a relatively simple tumbling pass. My entire
life crumbled, I had spent virtually every hour of my
life since the age of 6 working towards going to
the Olympics and in a moment it was all taken
from me. I didn't think I would ever do gymnastics
again and I fell into a deep depression, at my
lowest point I tried to commit suicide. 1 year ago
I could barely walk and went most places either with
a cane or a wheelchair. Today I went to my
first gymnastics practice in nearly a year and a half.
I don't know if I will ever be as good
as I was but for the first time in a
long time I have hope and I don't want to
die.

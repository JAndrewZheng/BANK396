I'm the only girl in the family since my mom
died a few years ago so I get princess treatment
from my older brothers and from my dad, yesterday was
my birthday, I turned 17, when I woke up I
saw a bouquet of roses on my bedside table, they
had a note on them wich read "happy birthday sis,
from Oliver" Oliver's my oldest brother, he was back from
the U.S for the a month, he was leaving the
morning of my birthday and left my a bouquet before
heading to the airport. Once I walked in the kitchen
I saw my dad and other brother making breakfast, they
made one of those traditional German breakfasts, after that I
had to go to football practice, I usually go with
my other two brothers who today decided to go to
the training ground a little early, when I got to
the training ground they were setting up a table, I
didn't think much of it since the club I play
for has these random snack tables where you can buy
drinks or something to eat before a match and I
walked in the dressing rooms and changed, walking out of
the dressing my brother put a blindfold on my face
and walked me to the table. When he took of
my blindfold I saw the entire team and some of
the coaches singing me happy birthday. It was one of
my best birthdays so far. I wouldn't change my brothers
for the world

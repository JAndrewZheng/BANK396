I have always made a point not to judge people
by their looks, past, or anything like that. And from
my experience, this is my favorite story on why. When
I was 15, I worked at a trampoline park. And
one day when I was working the front desk, a
man walked in with 5 kids, and who I aume
to be his wife of girlfriend. This man was big
and tall, around middle age, and was very very heavily
tattooed. While they were filling out paper work and getting
everyone checked in, I complimented his tattoos because I honestly
thought they were really cool. Looking embarraed and a little
nervous, he was honest and told me he had gotten
them done in prison, and was thinking about getting them
removed or altered. This led to one of the most
meaningful conversations of my life to date. We talked about
his tattoos and what they meant, if I wanted any
tattoos and what they would be, our religious viewpoints, our
families, and where we are from. He was so genuinely
kind and friendly to me, and wherever he is, I
wish him only happiness. This is a reminder to all
of you, to not judge people based on first impressions.
Be kind and give people a chance. ❤️

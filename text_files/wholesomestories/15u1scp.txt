My wife’s brother started dating his girlfriend Danielle two years
ago. They’d been very close since they were in Middle
School, and the timing was just right, as were the
feelings. Danielle had an ex-boyfriend that used to put hands
on her, and once her father realized, he was enraged.
But he was also recovering from a broken leg. So,
he reached out to Jason, my BIL. Jason was living
two hours away, and Danielle was hiding from him just
how bad her ex was treating her at the time.
The ex also got her pregnant, and Danielle’s father couldn’t
stand the idea of him being around his daughter and
grandchild. Years ago, I trained Jason in wrestling, and also
brought him with me to the boxing gym I used
to train at. I knew it would be good for
him, and given that my wife is my best friend
that I met back in the second grade, I wanted
him to be a better version of himself. When Danielle’s
father reached out to him to explain what her and
her ex’s relationship was really like, Jason dropped everything and
came back to town. When they went in to the
ultrasound, Jason was there instead of the ex at first.
The ex arrived moments after they found out that Danielle
was having a girl. He lunged at Jason after observing
the situation, not realizing what Jason was capable of. Jason
told the ex that it would end badly for him
if he was ever around Danielle ever again (not exactly
in those words.)A year after her daughter was born, she
and Jason began their relationship. Fast forward to the present
day, and that’s where the wholesome part comes in to
play. I had Jason at my house for a couple
of hours today, just him. I couldn’t help but notice
just how jovial he seemed to be, so I finally
asked him about it. He let a tear of joy
slide down his cheek as he explained that last night,
he and Danielle were about to go to sleep for
the night, when her daughter Amy, who’s now three, knocked
on the door to say that she couldn’t sleep. She
asked to sleep with the two of them, and it
was the first time she ever called Jason daddy. Jason
and Danielle both got choked up at that, as they
had never pushed on their daughter that Jason was her
father. (Everyone who knows about the situation does call little
Amy Jason’s daughter.)I put my hand on his shoulder, and
paraphrased Yondu. “He may have been her father, boy. But
you’re her daddy.” I got a good laugh out of
him for that one, before we shared a hug.I had
my own reason for having Jason over. I’m on my
second marriage after I was made a widower seven years
ago. I left my old wedding band in her casket,
but still have the one I gave her. Hers didn’t
have a diamond, it had her birthstone, a pearl. As
it happens, Danielle was also born in June, and her
birthstone was also a pearl. I gave Jason my wife’s
old ring, and told him to propose with it. I
know he wants to marry her, and since she’s pregnant
again, there doesn’t seem like a better time to pop
the question.

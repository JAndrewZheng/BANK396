Okay,
so
I
don’t
think
I’m
the
ahole
but
want
some
outside
opinions.
Also,
I’m
on
mobile
so
sorry
for
that.
My
dad
is
getting
married
in
July
of
2024.
I
like
his
fiancé
and
have
no
problems
with
her,
I
just
don’t
really
know
her
that
well.
I’m
due
to
give
birth
to
my
second
child
in
December.
I
told
my
dad
that
while
I
wanted
him
there
the
day
I
gave
birth,
I
didn’t
want
his
fiancé
there,
but
she
was
more
than
welcome
to
come
the
day
after.
He
said
he
understood,
but
got
a
little
upset
and
said
if
she
wasn’t
invited
the
day
of
then
he
wouldn’t
be
coming
til
the
next
day
either.
Now
while
I
get
where
he’s
coming
from
I
don’t
think
it’s
fair
he
gave
me
an
ultimatum
seeing
as
that
day
wouldn’t
be
about
him
and
I
should
be
able
to
have
people
I’m
100%
comfortable
with
at
the
hospital
while
I
give
birth.
Should
I
just
suck
it
up
and
invite
her
or
tell
him
he
can
come
the
next
day?
He
was
there
for
my
first
time
giving
birth
and
it
helped
to
have
his
hand
to
hold
during
contractions,
but
if
he’s
going
to
act
like
this
I
don’t
know
if
it’s
worth
it.
So,
AITA?ETA:
before
they
were
engaged
he
was
fine
with
her
not
coming
to
the
hospital.Edit2:
my
dad
won’t
be
in
the
room
while
I’m
actually
pushing
but
with
kid1
he
was
there
before
and
after
to
hold
my
hand
and
tell
me
everything
was
gonna
be
okay.
I
have
really
bad
anxiety
and
he’s
one
of
my
number
1
support
people.

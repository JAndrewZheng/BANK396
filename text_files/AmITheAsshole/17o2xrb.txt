AITA My fiancé was sitting with me timing my contractions
when all of a sudden he thought it would be
okay to tickle my feet. I told him to stop
and he did it again. So I told him he
was making me off. He got mad and said he
was just joking and trying to help me go into
labor. I asked him why it seemed funny when I’m
obviously in pain. No one would want to be tickled
while having contractions. He then proceeded to say whatever and
storm out of the room. Did i overreact ?

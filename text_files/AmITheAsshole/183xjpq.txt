This
all
happened
at
my
recent
birthday
party
and
I
need
some
unbiased
judgment.
Let
me
set
the
stage:
So,
it's
my
birthday
party
and
everything
is
bumping,
I'm
talking
fun
as
f,
until
my
friend
(who
we'll
call
Abby)
decides
to
dig
up
a
box
of
my
old
love
letters
from
high
school.
Now,
these
letters
are
cringe-worthy
with
over-the-top
poetry
and
declarations
of
eternal
love.
I
was
an
awkward
girl
in
my
teens
and
thought
poetry
was
the
crap,
so
I
wrote
abt
any
guy
I
thought
was
hot
at
the
time.But
in
an
attempt
to
lighten
the
mood,
Abby,
after
a
few
drinks,
decides
it
would
be
a
fantastic
idea
to
gather
everyone
for
a
dramatic
reading
of
these
vintage
gems.
So
like,
yeah,
sure,
the
room
erupted
into
laughter,
but
I
was
embarraed
and
kinda
(really)
pissed
off.
I
felt
really
exposed.
So
I
get
a
little
awkward
and
I'm
like
"Abby
where'd
you
find
these?"
because
I
swear
I
didn't
just
have
them
lying
around.
She
could
tell
I
was
caught
off
guard,
so
she
got
defensive
and
went
"It
doesn't
really
matter,
they're
just
silly"
and
we
start
getting
ticked
off
at
each
other.
I
know
she
didn't
mean
to
upset
me,
but
it
was
my
birthday
and
I
felt
embarraed
as
hell.
We
start
going
back
and
forth,
and
I
did
something
I'm
not
really
proud
of.Abby
and
I
have
a
mutual
friend,
who
we'll
call
Nicole,
and
she
likes
to
sleep
around
a
bit.
I'm
not
that
type
of
person
myself
but
I'm
not
gonna
judge.
about
a
week
b4
the
party,
Nicole
tells
me
that
one
thing
led
to
another
and
she
ended
up
sleeping
with
Abby's
boyfriend
more
than
once.
I
didn't
tell
Abby
at
the
time
because
Nicole
said
she'd
tell
Abby
about
it
herself.
Because
I
was
so
upset
at
my
party,
I
go
"At
least
I
don't
stay
with
a
man
that's
cheating
on
me".
But,
Nicole
never
told
Abby
about
what
happened.
So...

my
comment
at
the
party
unintentionally
spilled
the
beans
on
her
own
relationship.Abby
is
upset,
rightfully
so,
about
the
reveal
of
her
boyfriend's
infidelity.
Nicole
also
got
pissed
and
said
Abby
wasn't
supposed
to
know,
even
though
she
said
herself
that
she
would
tell
her?
This
whole
thing
has
blown
up
into
something
way
bigger
than
it
started
as
now.
I
never
meant
for
the
party
to
take
such
a
serious
turn.
AITA
for
what
I
said
to
save
face
after
Abby
embarraed
me?

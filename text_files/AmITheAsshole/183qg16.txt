Really
looking
for
perspective
on
either
side
of
this.
We
recently
had
a
baby,
and
my
MIL
is
very
judgemental
and
constantly
telling
us
we're
doing
things
wrong
and
that
we
should
do
things
the
way
she
did
them.
My
husband
will
absolutely
call
her
out
if
he
hears
it
and
say
"nope,
we're
not
doing
that
and
here's
why."
I'm
a
little
more
reserved,
but
I'll
still
say
things
like
"oh
actually
I
read
this
is
the
new
way
to
do
it,
or
I
was
told
this
by
the
nurse"
and
I
won't
be
as
blunt.But
I'm
starting
to
want
to
be
blunt.
In
particular,
she
will
make
comments
and
be
really
unsympathetic
when
I
talk
about
not
getting
enough
sleep
because
baby
still
wakes
up
in
the
night.
She'll
also
tell
me
NOT
to
feed
my
baby,
that
he's
eating
too
much
(he's
56th
percentile,
very
average)
and
to
just
let
him
cry.
These
are
just
some
examples.She
likes
to
mention
that
her
kids
slept
really
well
and
that
she
actually
had
to
wake
them
to
feed
them.She'll
also
tell
stories
about
how
her
breastmilk
dried
up
at
6
months
and
how
she
constantly
had
to
take
her
babies
to
the
hospital...
I
don't
understand
how
she
doesn't
put
two
and
two
together!?She
tells
me
how
great
her
kids
slept
every
time
I
see
her
and
I
just
want
to
tell
her
"Actually
you
were
starving
them!
That's
why
your
breastmilk
dried
up
and
that's
why
they
slept
all
the
time,
because
they
were
exhausted!
And
they
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
all
the
time
because
of
malnutrition!"
Like
our
nurses
and
midwives
all
told
us
to
be
concerned
if
our
newborn
was
sleeping
too
much
and
not
eating.I
think
that
would
make
her
feel
bad
though,
and
she's
really
proud
of
her
kids.
I
don't
want
to
make
her
feel
bad,
but
I
don't
like
how
she's
making
me
feel
bad
and
like
I
constantly
have
to
defend
my
parenting
choices.
I'm
worried
I'm
getting
to
the
point
where
I
might
say
something
the
next
time
she
does
this.
WIBTA?
Any
other
ideas
on
what
to
do?
I'm
hoping
just
venting
here
will
help
lol.Edit:
Thanks
everyone
for
all
the
great
suggestions.
Venting
here
really
did
help
and
now
I'm
got
some
new
ideas
to
try
out
instead.

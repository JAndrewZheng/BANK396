Perhaps
a
tame
post,
nothing
has
quite
erupted
yet
-
if
it
ever
does.
TLDR:
Paive
Parents
made
Thanksgiving
Miserable.In
my
family,
Thanksgiving
has
always
been
-
My
brother
and
I.-
My
Parents/Paternal
Grandparents
-
Aunt/Uncle/Cousin-
Another
Aunt
and
Uncle
-
Some
More
Cousins
-
Two
Very
Close
Family
Friends
(pretty
much
family)My
family
has
always
been
very
close.
About
2
months
ago
or
so,
my
grandfather
paed
away
after
a
long
battle
with
dementia
and
kidney
issues.
Needless
to
say
my
family
was
heartbroken
and
was
just
trying
to
process
all
of
it.
My
grandmother
and
my
father
are
still
trying
to
process
it.
So,
fast
forward
to
this
Thanksgiving.
Mostly
the
same
crowd
coming
over
to
our
place,
except
this
time
around
we
had
my
cousin,
his
wife,
their
two
kids,
and
my
cousin's
parents
come
over.
We
always
welcome
extended
family
that
we
don't
get
to
see
a
lot.
However,
disaster
quickly
struck.
The
kids
were
among
the
most
undisciplined
we
have
ever
seen.
Running
all
over
the
house,
jumping
on
furniture,
etc.
Just
being
totally
out
of
control.
At
one
point,
my
father
talks
to
the
girl
and
tells
her
to
stop
climbing
up
on
our
porch
railing
because
it
could
break
and
she
could
fall
the
20
feet
or
so
to
the
ground
and
hurt
herself
(my
parents
live
on
a
mountain).
The
girl
then
proceeded
to
talk
back
with
an
attitude
to
my
dad,
basically
refusing
to
stop
and
telling
him
that
it
won't
break.
So,
you
think
the
parents
would
be
involved
with
disciplining
their
children.
It
was
the
total
opposite.
They
were
completely
paive,
just
sitting
there
not
even
acknowledging
their
kids
in
any
way.
They
let
them
do
whatever
with
minimal
consequences.
Finally,
THEY
LEAVE
FOR
2
HOURS
OR
SO
to
get
some
stuff
for
their
kids
from
the
store
(they
would
be
spending
the
night
with
my
cousin's
parents).
When
they
leave,
his
parents
do
a
little
bit
of
a
better
job,
but
still
very
hands
off.
Basically
put
the
kids
in
my
dad's
movie
room
alone
and
turned
on
the
TV
and
left
em
down
there
for
like
20
minutes
at
a
time.
Because
of
this,
my
older
brother
and
his
girlfriend
took
care
of
the
kids
begrudgingly
and
despised
it.
My
dad
was
having
to
keep
a
constant
eye
on
them
to
make
sure
they
didn't
break
anything.
They
finally
leave,
and
we
were
exhausted
and
just
frustrated.
My
mom's
parents
(who
watch
these
kids
all
the
time)
couldn't
believe
the
behavior
and
lack
of
discipline
from
the
parents.
My
dad
was
super
upset.
Today,
my
dad
said
"I
didn't
even
get
a
chance
to
process
our
first
Thanksgiving
without
my
dad."
That
really
just
made
my
heart
hurt.
Needless
to
say
my
father,
who
is
60,
and
my
mother,
who
is
58,
are
exhausted.
Overall,
they
just
don’t
even
want
to
host
these
kids
anymore
or
deal
with
kids
from
that
side
of
the
family
because
they
are
just
so
worried
it’ll
be
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again.
Im
sure
if
this
family
finds
out
they’ll
be
upset
with
us,
but
I
think
my
parents
deserve
better
then
to
be
babysitters
for
kids
they
barely
see
and
know
at
all.
My
parents
are
already
in
a
maive
fight
against
a
seriously
delusional,
horrible,
manipulative
woman
on
the
same
side
of
the
family
and
don’t
need
another
fight
from
them.

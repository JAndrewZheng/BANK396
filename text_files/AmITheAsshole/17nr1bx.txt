My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2
years and live together. He has an 11 year old
daughter who lives nearly full time with her mom out
of state. I've met his daughter and she has been
over to our house maybe a total of 3 times.
We have a cat who we all love dearly, including
my two kids. When his daughter does visit, she plays
with our cat and has had no issues.  Recently,
my boyfriends ex contacted him saying their daughter had a
"severe allergic reaction to a cat and had to go
to the doctor and that she is allergic to cats"
My boyfriend mentioned the possibility of getting rid of our
cat because of this. Am I the asshole for not
wanting to get rid of our beloved family pet for
his daughter who is maybe at the house 1-2 times
a year, who never had any issues before??

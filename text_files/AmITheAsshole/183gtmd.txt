My
girlfriend
(30F)
and
I
(27M)
have
been
together
for
around
3
years.
We
live
in
a
VHCL
area.
I
make
good
money
(around
$150k
per
year
+
c.
$50k
in
bonuses)
and
have
a
good
amount
of
savings.
She
makes
less
than
me
(around
$60k)
and
has
virtually
no
savings.
Neither
of
us
has
any
debt.
I
am
from
a
relatively
poor
family
so
I’m
feeling
a
bit
of
pressure
from
the
big
expenses
likely
to
be
coming
up
(i.e.
wedding,
purchasing
a
house)
which
I
will
be
doing
without
parental
help.

My
girlfriend
and
I
talked
a
lot
about
our
future
together
and
we
are
both
on
the
same
page
about
getting
married
in
the
near
future.
We
recently
spent
a
good
amount
of
time
thinking
about
her
engagement
ring.
The
style,
type
of
cut,
4
Cs,
lab
vs
mined
etc.
We
were
both
quite
unknowledgeable
about
diamonds
so
had
to
do
a
lot
of
research.

She
was
aware
that
lab
diamonds
were
much
cheaper
than
mined
diamonds
and
expressed
that
she
was
happy
to
go
for
that
as
it
would
mean
she
could
get
a
much
higher
quality
ring
than
otherwise.
We
also
went
out
to
a
few
places
to
try
different
options
on
her
finger,
after
which
she
decided
on
her
dream
ring.
I
never
gave
her
a
particular
budget
for
the
ring
because
I
had
done
research
on
lab
diamonds
and
knew
that
I
could
likely
afford
whatever
she
wanted.
She
has
a
habit
of
not
really
looking
at
the
prices
of
things
so
I
am
quite
certain
at
this
stage
she
didn’t
fully
understand
just
how
much
cheaper
lab
diamonds
were
vs
mined
diamonds.

Since
she
had
now
decided
on
the
ring
she
wanted,
I
went
out
separately
and
bought
a
lab
diamond
ring
for
c.
$6.5k
that
matches
exactly
what
she
decided
on.

Over
the
last
few
weeks,
my
girlfriend
has
probably
been
researching
on
her
own
a
bit
more
and
also
speaking
with
friends
about
the
prices
of
lab
diamonds
and
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ring
I’m
getting
for
her
will
be
too
cheap.
She
is
now
quoting
the
3
month
salary
rule
(i.e.
for
me
that
means
I
need
to
be
spending
c.
$37.5k
on
a
ring).
I
spoke
with
her
on
multiple
occasions
about
how
spending
less
on
a
ring
means
that
we
will
have
more
money
for
the
wedding
itself
/
honeymoon
and
a
house
when
we
get
around
to
purchasing
one.
However
as
soon
as
she
spends
time
with
her
friends
the
topic
comes
up
again
and
we
end
up
arguing.

What
frustrates
me
about
the
situation
is
that
she
seems
hell-bent
on
spending
more
money
for
the
sake
of
spending
money.
The
ring
will
be
exactly
like
what
she
picked
out
and
she
was
incredibly
happy
before
she
knew
what
the
price
was
likely
to
be.
This
has
been
going
on
for
a
few
weeks
now
and
honestly
I
am
starting
to
have
doubts
creep
into
my
mind
about
whether
I
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
proposal
if
she
is
materialistic
enough
to
place
more
importance
on
a
ring
than
the
strength
of
our
relationship.

TLDR:
I
am
getting
my
girlfriend
a
ring
that
meets
all
the
specifications
she
selected,
but
after
finding
out
the
price
is
likely
to
be
less
than
she
expected
and
is
now
upset.
AITA?

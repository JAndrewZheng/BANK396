Roommates
second
account,
so
its
not
on
my
main.
On
phone.
Two
friends,
Grace
and
Alice,
and
I
would
go
on
a
week-long
road
trip.
We
took
my
car
and
the
plan
was
to
mostly
camp
(first
and
last
night
in
a
hotel).
Grace
and
I
would
alternate
driving,
so
the
other
could
rest
or
nap
when
necessary.
Alice
doesn't
have
a
license
so
she
navigated
and
would
therefore
stay
in
the
front
seat.That's
where
the
problem
arose,
Alice
suddenly
put
her
legs
on
the
dashboard,
I
asked
if
she
could
please
sit
down
normally.
She
didn't
understand
that
because
"this
won't
bother
you,
will
it?"
I
tried
to
explain
what
happens
when
you
have
an
accident
sitting
like
that
and
that
I
didn't
want
to
be
responsible
for
that.
Alice
thought
I
was
joking
so
started
laughing.
I
stopped
at
a
gas
station
to
continue
talking.
After
a
while
she
angrily
said
that
she
would
sit
normally
again
but
she
still
didn't
understand
the
problem.
Grace
and
Alice
then
went
to
the
gas
station
to
get
something.
I
stayed
at
the
car.At
the
toilet
a
little
later
I
overheard
Grace
say
"I
think
it's
nonsense
too,
but
you
know
how
she
can
be,
when
she's
sleeping
you
can
just
sit
like
that".
When
they
came
back
I
said
that
I
wanted
Alice
only
in
the
back
of
the
car.
This
turned
into
an
argument
again.
I
did
not
say
that
I
heard
their
conversation,
I
didn't
feel
like
that.
Because
Alice
kept
refusing
to
sit
in
the
back,
I
called
the
hotel
to
cancel.
This
made
them
both
very
angry
and
they
took
all
their
stuff
and
called
an
Uber.
I
drove
myself
back
home.
At
home
I
noticed
a
lot
of
messages
and
missed
calls
from
mutual
friends
and
family
saying
some
unkind
things.
Alice
had
made
a
post
on
social
media
about
what
a
terrible
friend
I
am.
I
saw
that
they
went
camping
before
they
blocked
me.I
thought
this
would
be
for
the
best,
I
did
not
want
her
to
be
folded
up
like
a
pretzel
in
an
accident
and
lose
her
legs.
It's
my
car
so
my
rules
and
my
responsibility
if
something
goes
wrong.
But
many
friends
and
family
think
I
exaggerated
and
perhaps
I
shouldn't
have
reacted
that
way.
Maybe
I
shouldn't
have
canceled
the
hotel
and
gone
home.Am
I
the
ahole
for
cancelling
and
going
home?
And
am
I
a
bad
friend?

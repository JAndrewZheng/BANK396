I don’t know how much of the details I need
to include. I found this place on TikTok and people
seem to care hereWe celebrated my gf’s birthday a few
days ago and my two daughters were invited. My daughters
love my gf and think that she is cool. Anyway
when we arrived before the party my gf’s mother was
still braiding my gf’s hair. She is great at it.
My daughters were in awe and when gf’s mom asked
of they liked it they said yes and that they
wanted that too. She told them to ask me first.
I’m white and so are my daughters with long blond
hair. I said to go ahead and they were very
happy. The mother was very gentle. When they got back
to their mother’s house, my ex wife, she was irate.
She called to yell for about 15 minutes and what
made her even angrier is that the girls refused to
take the braids out. I told her that I was
the father and I should be able to make small
decisions (I’m aware that big decisions are made by both).
She said now she doesn’t want my gf near our
daughters and she will take actions if I didn’t comply.Was
I the AH?

Me
and
my
girlfriend
were
at
a
friendsgiving
and
there
was
around
9
or
10
people
there
and
my
gf
was
invited
and
asked
me
if
I
wanted
to
go
with
her
so
I
said
yes
even
though
I
didn’t
know
anyone
there
(
all
her
friends
and
their
bfs)
Me
and
my
gf
just
started
dating
recently
less
than
2
months
ago
but
we
had
known
each
other
for
6
months
before
that.
Some
context
I’m
mixed
with
mainly
3
different
ethnicities
but
I’m
majority
(%50)
Chinese
and
my
gf
is
a
white
lady
and
her
friend
“A”
is
hispanic.So
we
are
all
sitting
around
the
couch
and
chatting
when
the
topic
of
bryce
hall
got
brought
up
and
my
gf
says”
doesnt
(Me)
look
like
bryce
hall”(popular
tiktoker)
Ive
been
told
this
once
before
except
they
said
the
“asian
version”.
And
one
of
her
friends
let’s
call
her
“A”
says
“Ricegum?”
(asian
youtuber)
pretending
that
she
didn’t
hear
what
my
gf
had
said

and
just
saying
his
name
because
were
both
asian,
we
kinda
laugh
it
off
but
since
I
didn’t
know
anyone
i
kind
of
felt
akward
and
5
minutes
later
my
gf
was
talking
about
how
she
had
a
decaf
frappuccino
from
starbucks
that
morning
and

“A”
has
gone
with
her
and
the
barista
had
made
a
comment
and
said
“why’d
she
get
a
decaf”
and
I
teased
her
after
she
said
that
because
I
know
how
much
she
loves
caffeinated
coffee.
I
said
“Why
WOULD

YOU
get
a
decaffeinated
coffee?”.
“A”
then
blurts
out
“Whats
ricegum
talking
about?”
and
the
room
went
silent.
Obviously
these
are
people
I
don’t
know
AT
ALL
and
I
had
let
it
go
the
first
time
but
the
second
time
it
got
under
my
skin
and
i
excused
myself
and
my
gf
comes
after
me
and
tries
to
defend
her
friend
saying
she’s
harmless
and
she’s
just
joking
but
not
one
sorry.
My
mood
was
ruined
so
i
told
my
gf
to
have
fun
with
her
friends
and
I
left.
My
gf
got
mad
that
i
left
and
said
i
embarraed
her
in
front
of
her
friends,
AITA?TLDR:
Left
gf
at
friendsgiving
because
her
friends
made
multiple
racist
comments

Me and my group of close friends goes out to
drink reasonably often, and we all take turns being DD
in a rotation of sorts.The issue for me is that
I'm heavily visually impaired, to the point where I can't
and never will be able to legally drive, even using
bioptics or other aistive tech. Instead, on "my nights", I
pay for an Uber or Taxi for all of us,
which others have said is a completely acceptable option for
them. The problem comes up with me drinking on my
nights. Even though I'm not actually driving (and can't reasonably
be expected to), one of my friends expressed that it's
not fair that I get to drink on my nights,
when everyone else holds back on their nights.In my view,
it's not unfair at all -- if anyone else wanted
to drink on their own night, they're more than welcome
to pay for an Uber the way that I do
every time it's my night -- they just usually choose
not to.Am I the ahole? I'm no alcoholic and am
more than fine going through an event or outing without
drinking or anything, but I also don't see the point
in holding back when I reasonably could have one.

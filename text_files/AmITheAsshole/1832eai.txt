I
used
to
suffer
an
eating
disorder,
and
as
a
result
was
120
pounds
at
5’11.
A
year
ago,
my
friends
got
me
into
weight
lifting,
and
since
then,
I’ve
been
bulking,
essentially
eating
excess
amounts
of
food
to
gain
muscle
ma.
Currently
I’m
at
175
with
a
good
amount
of
muscle
*and*
pudge,
and
am
planning
to
go
on
a
cut
soon.I
went
to
my
yearly
checkup
a
few
days
ago,
and
my
doctor
said
I
had
gained
a
lot
of
weight,
was
approaching
being
overweight,
and
needed
to
cut
back.
I
explained
that
I
was
bulking
and
also
pointed
out
I
had
my
yearly
blood
work
done
recently
and
all
the
factors
were
*healthier*
than
they
were
in
the
past
when
I
had
an
ED.He
scoffed
and
said
he’s
the
expert,
not
me,
so
I
should
listen
to
him.
I
asked
what
exactly
was
mistaken
about
in
saying
it
seemed
I
was
healthier,
but
he
refused
to
tell
me
and
just
reiterated
I
needed
to
listen
to
him.
After
the
appointment
my
mom
said
I
was
in
the
wrong
for
‘arguing’
with
a
doctor.
Am
I?
I
feel
like
he
was
being
condescending
if
anything.
AITA?Edit:
my
diet
is
monitored
by
a
registered
dietician.

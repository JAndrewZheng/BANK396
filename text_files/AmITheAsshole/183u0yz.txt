Me
and
my
family
(my
mom,
my
sister
and
I)
just
recently
moved
to
a
new
apartment
complex
and
it's
been
about
a
month
or
so.
My
sister
has
a
boyfriend
that
she's
been
with
for
almost
3
years
now
who
my
mom
and
I
are
very
comfortable
with.
Although
he
is
someone
we
are
comfortable
with
sometimes
I
found
it
awkward
to
catch
him
at
our
home
while
no
one
is
there.
He
went
out
to
Walmart
and
made
keys
for
everyone
for
our
new
house.
It
was
greatly
appreciated
but
he
also
made
himself
his
own
key
without
telling
anyone.
At
our
other
house
he
would
stay
for
his
breaks
since
his
family
lives
out
further
and
our
home
was
closer
to
his
job
and
still
is.
My
mom
and
I
didn't
have
a
problem
with
that
but
it
seems
as
he
depends
on
our
home.
If
we
lived
further
and
not
as
close
to
his
job
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
lounge
for
his
breaks
and
shower
here
and
get
ready
here
as
well.
A
couple
weeks
ago
he
had
gotten
sick,
and
my
sister
would
continuously
kiss
him
knowing
he
was
sick
and
got
us
all
sick
since
he
would
lay
on
our
couch
and
just
watch
tv
while
coughing
everywhere
and
got
my
sister
sick
which
just
would
spread
more
and
more
germs.
I
didn't
blame
him
the
first
time
since
people
in
my
school
were
getting
sick
as
well
but
the
2nd
time
it
had
died
down
and
he
was
STILL
sick
and
would
STILL
come
over
to
lounge
and
was
just
spreading
his
germs.
My
sister
didn't
care
and
didn’t
say
anything
to
him
and
would
continue
to
kiss
him
and
share
food
with
him
etc.
I
had
gotten
sick
because
of
him,
(which
was
because
he
was
not
only
here
all
the
time
but
sleeping
on
me
and
my
mom
beds
during
his
break
because
he
was
“tired")
and
I
brought
it
to
her
(my
sister)
attention
to
which
she
dodged
everything
I
said
and
made
it
seem
like
I
had
something
against
him.
I
told
her
that
I
don't
have
a
problem
with
him,
and
I
do
consider
him
like
an
older
brother,
but
it
is
not
fair
for
him
to
spread
his
sickness
just
because
he
wants
to
be
here,
and
she
wants
him
here.
He
drinks
up
all
our
waters
and
doesn't
care
to
refill
it
nor
finish
them.
He
will
grab
a
water
bottle,
drink
half
of
it,
forget
about
it
then
grab
another
one
and
there
will
be
half
drunken
water
bottles
everywhere.
Even
at
one
point
he
stayed
at
our
house
for
a
week
because
he
was
working
double
shifts
and
drunk
all
the
water
we
had
and
didn't
replace
anything,
and
my
sister
enables
it.
She
doesn't
think
he
does
anything
wrong
because
that's
her
“man”
and
I'm
quite
tired
of
it.
He
doesn't
clean
up
after
himself
and
is
possessive
over
a
tv
that
isn't
his.
He
likes
to
“take
over”
our
living
room
tv
and
doesn't
like
for
other
people
to
watch
tv
while
he's
there.
He’ll
even
go
up
to
you
and
say,
“don't
take
over
the
tv
while
I'm
gone,
I'm
still
using
it”
ITS
NOT
EVEN
YOUR
TV?!Anyways,
AITA
for
not
wanting
my
sisters
boyfriend
around
anymore
and
to
not
want
him
to
have
a
key
to
our
house?

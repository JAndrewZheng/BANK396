AITA?
I
(23F)
have
been
with
my
boyfriend
for
ten
months.
It
was
his
twin
sisters
wedding
three
weeks
ago
and
I
was
his
plus
one.
A
lot
of
things
went
wrong
on
her
wedding
day.
First
her
makeup
artist
cancelled,
then
their
grandfather
got
into
a
car
accident,
then
the
bartender
cancelled
as
well.
When
the
bartender
cancelled
my
boyfriend
offered
me
to
do
it.
I
am
a
bartender
as
my
fulltime
job
and
I
did
want
a
break
from
work
since
this
was
my
only
day
off
for
weeks
but
I
agreed
with
a
bawling
bride
in
front
of
me.
My
boyfriend
told
me
that
it
was
a
smell
set
up
with
a
limited
bar
but
when
we
got
there
it
wasnt.
I
could
tell
it
was
an
open
bar,
and
yupâ€¦
I
was
pissed.
I
couldnt
back
out
then
though
and
I
was
swarmed
all
night.
I
was
wearing
a
tight
dress
and
strappy
heels
that
were
a
bitch
to
take
off
so
I
had
to
have
them
on
all
night.
Six
straight
hours
of
overly
drunk
people
yelling
at
me.
Im
not
sure
if
they
thought
too
much
of
an
open
bar
since
a
lot
of
people
got
way
too
drunk
and
had
to
leave
early
or
were
acting
crazy.
After
that
my
boyfriends
sister
sent
me
a
long
text
thanking
me
profusely
saying
she
so
happy
I
helped
out
so
much
and
was
grateful.
I
replied
thank
you
and
thought
she
would
send
a
form
of
compensation
but
nothing.
I
felt
awkward
asking
first
so
I
brought
it
up
to
my
boyfriend
and
he
looked
confused
saying
it
was
a
favor
and
there
was
no
compensation
and
that
their
parents
already
paid
the
bartender
a
lot
of
money
and
they
weren't
getting
a
full
refund
plus
all
the
alcohol
they
bought
for
the
open
bar,
it
would
be
out
of
budget
and
inappropriate
for
me
to
ask
them
to
pay
me
AFTER
the
wedding
already
happened.
He
said
his
parents
planned
the
wedding
not
his
sister
so
it
would
be
them
that
paid
me
and
thats
not
okay
for
me
to
do
since
they
spent
so
much
money
already.
And
that
I
was
being
an
ahole
to
even
want
to
ask.I
felt
horrible
and
I
told
my
parents
when
I
saw
them
over
the
weekend
and
they
told
me
that
he
was
manipulating
me
and
that
I
do
deserve
to
be
paid
for
working
6
hours.
My
dad
says
he
was
the
one
to
volunteer
me
in
the
first
place
and
put
me
in
an
uncomfortable
situation
to
say
no
with
the
bride
right
in
front
of
me.
My
mom
says
they
should
give
me
half
the
refund
they
receive
from
the
original
bartender
and
add
another
half
and
to
ask
them
myself
directly.
AITA?

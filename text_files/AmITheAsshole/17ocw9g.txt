My stepsister turned 10 yesterday. Her dad had arranged for
her grandma (his mom) to take her for a girly
day. Her dad is married to my mom. Her dad
told me three weeks ago that I needed to take
her birthday off because she wanted me to go and
I (17f) was going. I told him I would not
take the day off and I was not going. He
told me not to argue with him and do it.
I told him I would not and he could not
force me to. Mom asked me if I would take
one day off and go for the girly day with
my stepsister. She said she was feeling pretty lonely and
wanted me there because she idolizes me. I told mom
I didn't want to spend a whole day with her
and her grandma and I had better things to do.
Mom didn't like it but she let the topic drop.Nobody
else mentioned it again after my mom and then yesterday
came and I went to work as normal and my
mom's husband starts calling and texting me demanding that I
leave work and go with his daughter and mom. I
ignored him and turned my phone off. He showed up
where I work and my boss kicked him out because
he was causing such a big disruption. I got home
later than usual because I went to my grandma's house
after work. But when I did get home he was
waiting for me and he said his daughter got home
early from her girly day because she was upset I
didn't show up and she had been expecting me. I
told him that I had never agreed to go and
he shouldn't have made any promises that I would. He
told me he ordered me to call off work and
I should have done it. Then he complained that I
had ruined his daughter's birthday and crushed her soul and
I should be fucking ashamed of myself.My mom, her husband
and I had an early birthday dinner Friday night to
celebrate my stepsister.Things are still very tense and my stepsister
is upset about yesterday. I heard her crying to her
dad earlier about it.AITA?

AITA
for
not
telling
my
brother
that
my
uncle
is
dying?
For
context,
my
brother
is
estranged
from
the
entire
family
except
for
me.
He
had
a
bad
falling
out
with
our
mother
and
cut
everyone
off
since
2013.
Went
no
contact
with
everyone
and
made
me
the
middle
man
for
relaying
info.
In
2021,
our
grandma
had
a
heart
attack
and
was
going
to
die.
I
told
him
and
he
asked
to
speak
with
her.
It
was
still
covid
protocol
at
the
hospital
so
only
2
visitors
at
a
time
and
he
lived
across
the
country.
they
had
ipads
with
zoom,
so
i
set
him
up
with
saying
goodbye
to
her
over
zoom.
i
had
to
ensure
my
mom
was
nowhere
near
her
room
when
he
was
on
though
bc
he
doesn’t
want
to
see
our
mom
or
interact
with
her
so
i
bent
over
backwards
to
trick
my
mom
into
staying
downstairs
of
the
hospital
until
he
was
done.
anyways,
grandma
died.
my
brother
emailed
us
both
with
a
throwaway
email
asking
how
we’re
going
to
deal
with
her
remains.
my
mom
wanted
her
cremated.
my
brother
said
he
thinks
she
should
be
made
into
a
tree
bc
she
was
big
on
gardening
and
nature.
mom
said
no.
he
didn’t
attend
her
funeral.when
my
mom
and
i
were
cleaning
out
her
house,
i
put
some
things
aside
for
my
brother
i
knew
he’d
like
to
have.
he
asked
me
for
a
tea
kettle
specifically,
he
said
it
was
a
nice
memory
from
his
childhood
at
her
house.
i
said
i
can’t
find
it.
it’s
not
here.he
then
sent
a
books
length
text
to
me
about
how
disgusting
i
am
for
“withholding”
something
he
wanted
from
him.
i
told
him
she
redid
the
entire
kitchen
like
5
years
ago.
she
probably
threw
it
out.anyways,
my
mom
and
i
were
flying
back
and
forth
between
our
house
and
grandma’s
bringing
items.
we
left
the
urn
the
first
go
around
bc
there
was
too
much
crap
to
bring.
i
told
my
brother
this.my
mom
flew
back
solo
a
few
days
later
and
asked
“….
where’s
the
urn?”
and
i
said…
huh?
on
the
counter
where
we
left
it.
she
said
she
flipped
the
entire
house
upside
down
and
is
having
a
mental
breakdown.
she
can’t
find
it.we
called
grandmas
neighbor
who
said
she
saw
my
brother
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade!
he
came
by
to
say
hello
to
her.
how
sweet!!well
turns
out
he
used
an
old
key
from
2013
to
break
into
her
house,
steal
the
urn
&
flew
home.
he
held
it
for
ransom
and
went
no
contact
with
everyone,
including
me.
he
sent
me
a
handwritten
letter
on
my
BIRTHDAY
saying
i’m
a
piece
of
crap
again
for
withholding
the
tea
kettle
and
putting
grandma
on
a
pedestal
when
she’s
actually
“a
bad
person”.
a
few
months
ago
he
sent
another
email
from
another
throwaway
demanding
cash
for
her
return.
eventually
we
got
the
urn
back.
after
2
years.
i
haven’t
spoken
to
him
since.now
my
uncle
is
in
hospice.
my
brother
and
i
are
very
fond
of
this
uncle.
he’s
an
amazing
person
and
about
to
die.
i
don’t
want
to
tell
ham
brother
bc
of
what
happened
with
our
grandma.
he’s
gonna
find
out
after
the
fact
and
i
don’t
care.
am
i
the
ahole?

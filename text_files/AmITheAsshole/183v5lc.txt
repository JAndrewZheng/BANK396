My
friends’
son
‘Gareth’(15)
asked
for
a
Stephen
King
novel
as
his
birthday
present.
When
he
asked
me
for
this,
his
parents
were
also
there
and
I
said
yes.
They
didn’t
protest.The
thing
is,
only
around
25%
of
our
country
is
fluent
English.
But
some
of
the
most
famous
Stephen
King’s
novels(
like
IT
and
The
Shining
et
cetera)
have
been
translated
into
our
native
language.
The
IT
translated
edition
can
be
found
in
almost
every
major
bookstore.
So
many
people
here
read
his
work
and
he
is
reasonably
well
known
even
here.
So
I
aumed
that
my
friends
knew
he
asked
for
a
horror
book
and
were
okay
with
it
when
I
said
yes,
and
I
bought
him
a
copy
of
The
Regulators
for
his
birthday.
My
friends
later
found
out
about
the
sort
of
stuff
he
writes
and
confronted
me
about
it.
I
thought
that
they
already
knew
but
they
said
they
didn’t.
They
got
curious
about
the
author
their
son
recently
started
reading
and
looked
him
up,
and
they
said
I
shouldn’t
have
aumed
that
they
already
knew.

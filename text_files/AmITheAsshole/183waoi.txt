Me
(30f)
and
my
twin
brother
live
in
different
cities.
Before
last
Christmas,
I
was
speaking
about
gifts
with
my
brother
and
he
was
unsure
what
gift
to
get
his
wife
(30f).
During
this
conversation,
I
mentioned
that
I
got
her
a
book
she
really
liked
in
a
library
when
they
came
over
on
a
previous
visit.
He
asked
if
I
he
could
pay
me
to
have
the
gift
for
her,
and
I
would
get
her
something
else.
I
agreed.
But
since
the
next
day
I
was
travelling
to
their
house
for
the
Christmas
dinner,
I
got
her
a
last
minute
bath
set.During
the
gift
exchange,
she
absolutely
loved
the
book
from
my
brother,
and
was
polite
about
my
gift.
However,
later
during
the
evening
she
mentioned
how
she
"understands
when
money
is
tight"
and
that
I
"could
get
more
thoughtful
gifts
next
time".
It
did
not
feel
good.
Then
we
travelled
back
home
and
never
spoke
about
this
again.Today,
I
am
speaking
to
my
brother
on
the
phone
and
discuss
about
Christmas
gifts.
I
tell
him
that
for
my
sister
in
law,
my
gift
is
a
wool
sweater
that
she
specifically
mentioned
she
liked
a
while
ago.
My
brother
asks
again
that
I
let
him
give
this
gift
to
her
and
that
I
get
her
something
else.I
said
no,
especially
after
last
year.
He
had
no
idea
that
my
sister
in
law
made
any
comments
and
said
that
maybe
I
interpreted
wrongly.
Then
he
said
he
actually
remembers
my
sister
in
law
speaking
privately
with
him
afterwards
and
saying
that
gifts
are
a
reflection
of
love
and
that
I
clearly
don't
put
much
thought
in
her
gifts.
I
asked
him
to
just
get
her
something
else
because
I
put
thought
in
my
gift,
and
have
no
idea
what
to
get
her
otherwise.
After
some
back
and
forth
I
agreed
to
let
him
have
the
gift,
but
I
told
him
I
am
not
coming
for
dinner
this
year
as
I
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
comments.
He
said
that
I
am
a
baby,
and
to
think
about
it.I
am
quite
upset
that
he
does
this
thing
of
asking
for
my
gift.
I
also
don't
put
that
much
pressure
on
myself
when
it
comes
to
gifts,
but
I
make
an
exception
with
my
sister
in
law
as
she
often
discusses
the
gifts
she
normally
gets.AITA
for
not
wanting
to
attend
dinner
this
year?Edit:
I
apologise
for
writing
this
in
a
haste
and
making
some
errors
in
typing.

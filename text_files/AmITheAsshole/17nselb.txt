My birthday was in September I originally wanted my boyfriend
and I to go out for bowling then dinner at
a cute little tapas place nearby. The night of, Rick
(BF, 23M) got called in to work to cover a
shift.Okay, disappointing but that's his work and it happens a
lot.We tried to reschedule for the following weekend. Again, he
got called in to work. Rick tried to make up
for it by giving me a necklace from his work
but I didn't take it. It felt like a half-assed
attempt at an excuse.Third time this happened, Rick gets called
in to work again. I begged him to not take
the shift but he did it anyway. Rick said that
his manager really needed coverage that night.So by now, I
haven't been able to celebrate my birthday. We live in
a more rural area, away from my family and friends.
I'm not close to his family. So I went, "fuck
it". I went into town, watched the Taylor Swift movie
and had dinner at the tapas place. I didn't want
to go back home so I rented a hotel room
for the night.When I go back, Rick was pissed. He
managed to talk his manager into letting him leave early!
He tried to make up for missing tapas and bowling
by getting fucking Whataburger and making a candlelit dinner out
of it to surprise me.I told him that this isn't
what I wanted and that if he really cared about
my birthday, he wouldn't have taken those shifts on the
weekends that we had planned my birthday on!!!He called me
ungrateful and that I need to deal with it. I
told hm that if he was an EMT or police
or a first responder, then I would be more understanding
because those jobs actually help the community. But he's makes
minimum wage stocking shelves at Walmart and doesn't have any
other plans going for him. Even a monkey can do
his job.I told him that I didn't want to celebrate
my birthday with him anymore and to just drop it.
It's been a couple of weeks and he's still pouting
about it. AITAH?

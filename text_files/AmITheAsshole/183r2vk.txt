‼️Probably
a
long
winded
post..please
bear
with
me‼️I
(29f)
and
my
fiancé
(31m)
will
be
getting
married
in
April
of
2024.
We’re
literally
counting
down
the
days
in
excitement.Some
important
information
to
keep
in
mind
for
now
is
that
my
parents
are
divorced,
they
have
been
for
around
4/5
years
now,
My
mother
is
very
bitter
about
this,
she
always
has
been
and
always
will
be,
along
with
the
bitterness
about
her
failing
marriage
she
has
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
me
getting
married
and
has
openly
stated
she
thinks
I’m
making
a
mistake
because
she
doesn’t
see
the
value
in
my
fiancé.
Not
once
since
he’s
physically
lived
here
in
the
past
2
years
(we
were
long
distance
for
5)
has
she
tried
to
get
to
know
him,
and
anytime
we
have
been
around
her
she
acts
like
he’s
just
some
stranger
I’m
dragging
around.
Meanwhile
my
father
and
his
wife
(remarried
for
almost
2
years)
have
been
so
welcoming
and
kind
to
him,
they
consider
him
family.
With
our
upcoming
wedding
we
knew
we
would
likely
be
paying
for
everything
and
we’re
happy
to
do
so,
though
I
did
ask
my
mother
if
she’d
want
to
have
any
part
in
helping
I
told
her
there
was
no
obligation,
I
just
figured
she
may
want
to
help…I
was
sorely
mistaken.Beyond
that
my
mom
(who
hasn’t
been
much
of
a
mother)
is
angry
that
I’ve
asked
her
to
“share
her
spotlight”
(as
she
put
it)
with
my
stepmom
for
the
mother
of
the
bride
walk.
She
claims
she’s
not
my
real
mother,
biologically
speaking
she’s
not
but
she’s
been
more
present
in
my
life
over
the
past
6
years
she’s
been
with
my
dad
than
my
bio
mom
ever
has.

With
her
clear
disliking
that
my
stepmom
would
be
included
there
is
more,
I
made
sure
my
half
sister
on
my
dads
side
was
included
in
my
wedding
partially
because
my
fiancé
asked
my
step
brother
(stepmoms
son)
to
be
a
groomsmen
they’re
around
the
same
age
so
walking
together
would
work
but
also
because
she’s
my
sister,
she’s
important
to
me,
I
have
a
half
sister
on
my
moms
side
as
well…she
has
a
history
of
starting
fights,
causing
a
scene,
crime
that
she’s
been
charged
for
…many
reasons
I
wouldn’t
want
her
to
be
a
bridesmaid,
plus
she’s
just
generally
unkind.
She’s
also
in
the
same
age
range
as
my
half
sister
and
step
brother.
My
mom
has
“jokingly”
made
threats
to
not
attend
my
wedding
“to
show
me
how
it
feels
to
have
my
feelings
hurt”
so
I
can
understand
how
I’m
making
her
feel…she’s
been
blatantly
disrespectful
as
of
late
and
aside
from
the
mother
of
the
bride
walk
wanted
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
our
wedding.After
everything
she
claims
I’m
asking
her
to
attend
out
of
pity
and
not
because
she’s
my
mother….it’s
my
day
and
I
want
to
have
a
relaxed
wedding,
I
feel
in
this
aspect
I’m
allowed
to
be
a
little
selfish
and
avoid
any
problems
my
moms
daughter
could
pose…
We
don’t
find
her
lack
of
presence
to
be
a
loss
and
truthfully
if
it
ends
our
“relationship”
as
mother
and
daughter
I
wouldn’t
mind
so
I
guess
I
just
want
to
know
AITA?

I (27f) come from a religious family, we are very
close and they are my support system. i stopped being
religious in my late teens but kept it a secret
because I enjoyed the religious celebrations and didn’t want to
face my parents as I knew they would be a
little disappointed if I told them. Anyhow I currently live
with my husband (30m) in another country, me and my
husband are from the same culture, so my parents **assumed**
he was also religious and I never corrected that assumption.
I call my family everyday, but we only visit them
once a year for a week or so. During this
week neither me or my husband pray or do anything
remotely religious and my family doesn’t comment on this, literally
no one cares. During casual conversations there are insinuations that
everyone present believes in god and so on, so they
definitely think we’re religious but we’re not devout or something.
My husband has been nagging me lately to tell my
parents we are atheists and I really don’t want to.
I don’t see what that will accomplish aside from making
them sad or even having them try to persuade us
to rejoin the religion. I asked my husband if my
parents pressured him to pray or fast or anything at
all, he said no. So I told it’s up to
him to tell them that he’s not religious that’s his
right, but he better leave me out of it. I
simply don’t want them to know. He lost it, he
said I was forcing him to lie and “live a
double life” and he doesn’t think that’s fair. I reiterated
that he’s free to tell them that ***he*** is not
religious but he cannot drag me to that conversation. He
told me to forget it and that he’s not coming
with me for our annual visit until I tell them,
so now I’m doubting myself, maybe I should tell them,
idk. So AITA ?

I will try to keep this short. I am 18
and when I was around 10 my mom cheated on
my father and got pregnant. This resulted in my half
sister Kathy. Soon after my parents cut my grandparents out
of our life. My parents stayed together. I turned 18
three months ago and my grandparents reached out.They informed me
over lunch that when Kathy was born they made it
clear they do not see her as a grandkid. That
she is the product of my mom cheating on her
son. They refused to make a college fund for her
and my parents cut them out due to it.They informed
me that I have a college fund from them and
I decide to take it. I came home and kept
it to myself. I have been reconnecting with them and
it came to a head today.  My parents 
learned who I was hanging out with.This resulting in an
argument for taking the money when they shun Kathy. I
told them they were right to not consider her a
grandkid and to screw then for cutting them out of
my life.They havenâ€™t talked to me since and I am
doubting myself.Since it was asked multiple times, Kathy bio dad
has partial custody, my dad never adopted her which according
to some redditors means that bio dad has to give
up his rights

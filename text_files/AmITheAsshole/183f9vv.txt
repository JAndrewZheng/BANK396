TL;DR
Am
I
the
ahole
for
insisting
that
my
step
siblings
take
over
care
for
my
stepfather
because
my
fragile
elderly
mom
is
in
no
shape
to
care
for
him
anymore?
My
90+
yo
stepfather
with
declining
health
has
no
end
of
life
plans.
The
romantic
part
of
my
parents
marriage
has
been
over
for
20+
years
and
now
my
frail
elderly
mother
with
post
stroke
speech
aphasia
is
struggling
to
care
for
him.
I
have
no
relationship
with
my
step
brother
who
is
nearest

next
of
kin
and
a
rude
person
to
my
mother.

So
I
usually
message
my
stepsister
who
lives
over
seas
to
communicate.
I
told
her
a
year
ago
it
was
time
for
her
and
her
siblings
to
come
together
and
make
plans
for
their
father
because
my
mom
was
unable
to
do
it.
A
year
paes
and
now
he
needs
round
the
clock
care.
My
mom
absolutely
cannot
continue
to
care
for
him
it’s
further
deteriorating
her
own
situation
and
I
have
no
bond
with
my
step
dad
to
want
to
take
that
task
on
when
he’s
got
4
able
bodied
children
who
can
muster
up
a
planIt’s
down
to
the
wire
this
thanksgiving
and
I’m
pregnant
and
my
mom
is
planning
to
move
in
with
me
and
help
care
for
the
baby
(hubby
and
I

plan
on
hiring
a
nanny
so
really
she’s
not
doing
any
grunt
work
but
she
a
self
sacrificing
bleeding
heart
and
don’t
know
that
yet
but
I
would
never
allow
my
mother
to
slave
away
caring
for
a
baby
in
her
condition)
any
wayI
message
my
stepsister
and
let
her
know
they
need
to
get
him
into
aisted
living
asap
because
my
mom
is
leaving
to
get
a
break
for
a
few
months
come
back
before
baby
is
born
and
settle
her
affairs
and
then
live
with
me
in
the
spring
of
2024.
Finally
the
stepson
comes
in
with
hospice
(eta:
hospice
only
provides
supplemental
care
if
you’re
not
within
6
months
of
dying)
not
discussing
anything
with
my
mother
or
collaborating
with
us.
Hospice
as
you
may
know
provides
only
supplemental
care
(eta
if
you’re
not
when
6
months
of
dying)
he
needs
ROUND
THE
CLOCK
care.
Stepbrother
has
medical
power
of
attorney
over
t
stepfather
and
has
long
ago
shut
my
mom
out
of
her
husbands
medical
affairs.
Instead
of
collaborating
with
us
he
makes
decisions
in
a
silo.
I
could’ve
told
him
that
hospice
wasn’t
going
to
be
enough.
Now
the
social
workers
want
my
mom
to
miss
her
flight
and
stay
while
he
gets
(eta:
round
the
clock
long
term
care
for
example
a
nursing
facility
or
a
home
health
aide)
long
term
care
situated.
I
put
my
foot
down
and
said
no
and
my
mom
agrees
let
his
son
figure
that
out.
My
mom
literally
should
not
be
caring
for
him.
Any
one
with
compaion
could
see
that.
Am
I
the
AH?
(ETA
AITA
for
taking
my
mom
out
of
the
picture?)ETA:
sorry
for
all
the
edits
I
wanted
to
make
sure
things
were
clear.

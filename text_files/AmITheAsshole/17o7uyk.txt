I (17f) let's call me Rarity which is a not
super common name like my real one, have a half
brother Kurtis (30m). He is married to Kendall (30f). Kendall
isn't related to me but shares my last name, my
brother changed his name to her last name when they
wed. This wasn't weird as his last name was one
he had been teased for when he was younger and
he and I are close so it was still a
family name that way too.Kendall is now in her third
trimester of pregnancy to a baby (f). They announced that
they want to name the baby Rarity. I wasn't thrilled
about it and I thought that that sounded like it
could be confusing or something. I asked about it and
if they plan on calling the baby something else like
a nickname or middle name. They said they were giving
her the same middle name as me and that it
would likely be obvious who is being talked about and
if not they could add the word "baby" in front
of it.I think this is super weird and don't like
it. My parents think it is "sweet." I tried to
express my dislike for it but everyone is just upset
with me for being unsupportive.EDIT: I did ask why and
they say it is a pretty name and my brother
says he hopes the baby will be just like me.
I also have directly asked if the name was like
for me or something and they said no

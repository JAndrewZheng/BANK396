I
(22F)
have
been
avoiding
my
down
syndrome
uncle
(46M)
at
recent
family
gatherings.I
have
known
my
uncle
my
entire
life.
He
lives
with
my
grandparents
and
has
always
been
at
family
gatherings.
I've
never
had
any
issues
with
him
until
the
last
two
or
three
years.
Growing
up,
my
family
used
to
live
very
close
to
a
lot
of
my
extended
family.
Around
the
time
I
had
turned
13,
my
family
moved
a
couple
hours
away.
We
saw
family
a
lot
less
often
after
the
move,
not
on
purpose
of
course,
just
life
getting
busier
as
people
get
older
I
guess.
I'm
in
college
now
which
makes
it
even
more
difficult.
I
really
only
see
my
extended
family
during
the
end
of
the
year
holidays
(Thanksgiving,
Christmas,
New
Years).
So
I
only
really
see
my
uncle
then.
I'm
not
sure
when
it
exactly
started,
but
my
uncle
has
started
to
make
comments
about
wanting
to
marry
me.
Specifically
saying,
"marry
you,
marry
you".
It
makes
me
a
little
uncomfortable.
I
think
what
makes
me
more
uncomfortable
is
that
my
dad
always
laughs
about
it
and
encourages
him.
This
now
happens
every
time
I'm
near
my
uncle,
it
feel
like
it's
the
only
thing
he'll
say
to
me.
This
has
now
extended
to
me
not
wanting
him
to
touch
me.
He
has
come
up
to
me
and
put
and
arm
around
me
or
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
while
saying
he
wants
to
marry
me.
So
I've
just
kind
of
been
avoiding
him
during
visits.My
mom
took
notice
at
Thanksgiving.
My
uncle
is
her
younger
brother,
and
she
is
fiercely
protective
of
him.
She
confronted
me
in
the
car
driving
home
(in
front
of
all
of
my
other
siblings)
asking
why
I
avoid
him.
I
told
her
essentially
what
I
typed
above.
She
and
my
Dad
don't
understand
why
that
would
make
me
uncomfortable.
They
have
both
said
that
it
shouldn't
bother
me
because
he
doesn't
understand
what
he's
saying,
"his
mind
is
like
a
5
year
olds"
and
"he
says
stuff
like
that
to
everyone".
Which
could
be
true,
I
haven't
seen
him
interact
with
any
of
my
female
cousins
in
a
while,
but
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
I
still
feel
uncomfortable
about
the
situation.
I
worry
that
my
mom
thinks
I
hate
my
uncle,
and
that
kind
of
offends
me.
I've
known
him
my
entire
life!
I
absolutely
do
not
hate
him,
and
I
understand
that
he
doesn't
understand
what
he
says
most
of
the
time.
I
told
my
mom
that
it's
just
something
I'll
deal
with
and
get
over,
but
I
fear
she
thinks
the
worst
of
me.
I
know
it's
not
a
very
nice
thing
to
do,
but
I
didn't
know
what
else
I
could
do
to
stop
the
"marry
you"
talk.

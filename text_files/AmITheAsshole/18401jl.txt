My
(40M)
daughter
is
17
years
old.
She
recently
got
her
car
a
few
months
ago.
We
already
have
ground
rules
in
our
house
regarding
her
boyfriend
(18M),
open
door
policy
and
no
sleepovers
obviously.
Life360.
When
she
got
her
license
we
extended
these
rules
to
make
sure
she
understands
we
don’t
condone
anything
inappropriate
happening
in
the
car
either.
After
that
conversation,
the
topic
was
left
alone.
I
gave
her
the
freedom.
Earlier
today
she
woke
up
at
8
am,
had
to
be
to
her
part
time
job
at
9.
She
takes
a
while
to
get
ready
and
she
started
complaining
that
she
left
something
in
her
car
and
didn’t
feel
like
bringing
it
inside.
I
told
her
I’d
grab
it
for
her
to
which
she
quickly
said
no
she’ll
get
it.
Her
insistence
seemed
weird
to
me
because
she
usually
has
no
issues
letting
me
get
something
her.
I
told
her
again
I’d
go
get
it.
When
I
looked
inside,
I
retrieved
what
I
came
for
but
I
also
saw
two
open
condom
packages.
I
didn’t
bring
it
up
until
she
got
home
at
2pm,
as
I
think
it’s
screwed
up
to
make
your
child
anxious
about
an
upcoming
conversation.
We
discussed
birth
control,
I
praised
her
for
safety,
but
I
added
she
broke
my
rule
so
there
will
have
to
be
consequences
mainly
towards
suspending
car
privileges,
and
probably
some
other
things.
She
was
obviously
upset
by
this
and
went
on
the
typical
teenage
“that’s
not
fair”
rant.
I
told
her
I’m
being
more
than
fair.
I’m
limiting
her
access
to
the
car
and
reworking
my
ground
rules.
My
parents
probably
would’ve
sold
the
entire
damn
car.
She
broke
my
boundary
and
she
broke
my
trust,
for
that
there
had
to
be
a
direct
consequence
that
fits
the
behavior.
She
got
really
upset
by
this
and
stormed
away,
and
has
not
spoken
to
me
in
a
few
hours.
AITA
for
giving
a
fair
punishment?

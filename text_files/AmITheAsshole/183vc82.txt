Hello
everyone,
I’m
lost
on
what
to
do
I
want
to
know
what
you
guys
would
do
in
my
position.
My
gf
[21]
is
pregnant
and
I
know
she
hasn’t
been
loyal
with
me
to
which
I
ended
things.
But
she
came
up
pregnant,
the
thing
is.
I
don’t
know
if
it’s
my
baby
or
not.
The
time
lines
from
when
she
got
pregnant
was
when
she
was
cheating
on
me
but
there
is
also
a
chance
that
the
baby
is
mine.
I
don’t
know
what
to
do.
I
want
to
kick
her
to
the
curb
so
bad,
if
it
wasn’t
for
the
possibility
of
it
being
my
baby,
she
would’ve
been
gone.
I
want
to
get
a
prenatal
test
but
they’re
too
expensive
for
me
to
afford.
Everytime
she
talks
about
the
baby
she
says
“my
baby”
instead
of
“our
baby”
and
anytime
I
bring
it
up
she
just
laughs
it
off
and
ignores
it
which
is
a
huge
red
flag
to
me.
Why
would
it
be
so
hard
to
just
say
“yes
it
is
our,
I’m
sorry”.
She
also
said
that
quote
“if
my
baby
comes
out
and
I
don’t
want
it,
I’ll
just
give
it
to
someone”
to
which
I
said
“no,
that
is
my
baby
too
and
I
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
sure
it
is
taken
care
of
by
me”.
The
relationship
has
been
failing
ever
since
she
cheated
(as
anyone
can
imagine).
The
only
reason
I
even
talk
to
her
is
because
of
the
possibility
it’s
mine
but
I
am
not
going
to
let
a
woman
who’s
pregnant
with
someone
else’s
kid
just
sit
at
my
house
all
day
and
relax
and
do
nothing,
that
would
be
my
responsibility
if
it
was
garunteed
mine.
I’m
afraid
I’m
wasting
valuable
time
and
money
on
this
woman
just
for
the
baby
to
come
out
not
mine.
What
do
I
do?
I’m
so
lost
and
need
help

Background:
My
husband
and
I
are
both
argumentative
people
who
have
sort
of
"tough"
personalities
(I'm
a
lawyer
and
he's
retired
military).
We
argue
frequently
about
facts
or
politics,
but
these
are
usually
good-natured
and
humorous.
But
I
try
not
to
do
this
if
we're
socializing
or
at
family
events,
since
no
one
wants
to
watch
another
couple
argue.



Almost
a
year
ago,
we
hosted
two
of
my
older
relatives
at
our
house
for
a
few
days.
All
was
well
until
the
topic
of
social
media
came
up
at
dinner.
I
mentioned
something
about
how
Twitter
was
a
toxic
waste
dump,
full
of
hostility.
My
husband
decides
this
is
something
to
argue
about
and
says
that's
not
true.
So
we
start
arguing
about
it,
and
he's
getting
angry.
Our
guests
were
clearly
becoming
uncomfortable
and
quiet.
Eventually
he
furiously
says
"this
conversation
is
over",
gets
up,
and
abruptly
leaves
the
room.
I'm
left
in
awkward
silence,
and
have
to
apologize
to
my
relatives.



After
they
left,
I
told
him
how
upset
I
was,
that
he
made
us
look
like
two
psychos
arguing
over
something
so
stupid,
and
that
wasn't
a
normal
way
to
act
with
guests.
He
apologized,
said
he
wouldn't
do
it
again,
and
admitted
to
me
that
Twitter
was
awful
and
didn't
know
why
he
even
argued
about
it.



Six
months
later,
we
were
visiting
with
another
relative
and
he
did
THE
SAME
THING.
About
the
same
topic!
I
don't
know
how
it
came
up,
but
he
angrily
argued
til
it
was
awkward
and
uncomfortable.
After
that,
I
was
VERY
UPSET.
Once
again,
he
apologized
and
promised
me
it
wouldn't
happen
again.
About
a
month
ago,
he
told
me
on
his
own
accord
that
he
was
thinking
of
deleting
Twitter
because
it
was
such
a
cesspool.



Then
at
Thanksgiving
hosted
by
my
cousin
yesterday,
he
does
it
AGAIN.



We're
sitting
at
the
table
having
a
pleasant
conversation,
and
my
brother
mentioned
that
after
the
initial
argument
where
he
stormed
out
of
the
room,
it
had
concerned
my
older
relative
so
much
that
she
had
told
my
family
she
was
concerned
for
our
marriage.
So
the
twitter
topic
came
up,
and
ONCE
AGAIN
he
starts
arguing
about
it
in
a
hostile
manner,
til
the
table
was
uncomfortable
and
quiet.
Finally
I
said
"are
you
seriously
going
to
gaslight
me
again
on
this
topic?
Did
you
not
just
tell
me
you
were
thinking
of
quitting
Twitter
because
it's
such
a
toxic
waste-dump??"
And
he
says
"not
in
those
exact
words".



I
was
furious
he
did
this
to
me
AGAIN,
and
we
didn't
speak
on
the
ride
home
or
for
the
rest
of
the
night.
Today,
he
says
nothing
to
me
and
doesn't
bother
to
acknowledge
it
or
apologize.
I
feel
like
I'm
married
to
some
big
domineering
gorilla
that
likes
to
make
displays
to
show
he's
in
charge
and
make
everyone
bow
down
to
his
foul
moods.
He
doesn't
even
actually
disagree
or
care
about
this
topic,
so
I
don't
know
why
he
does
this.




Finally
I
boil
over
and
tell
him
I
want
him
to
leave
the
house,
three
strikes
and
you're
out.
He
just
asks
"for
how
long"
and
I
said
I
don't
know.
He
then
stormed
around
angrily,
got
his
stuff,
and
left.

I
25M
had
recently
ordered
a
new
scent
from
my
favorite
mens
soap
company.
I
thought
nothing
of
it
and
a
week
had
past
and
it
had
arrived
the
morning
of
Thanksgiving.
I
was
super
excited
because
now
I
could
use
one
of
their
new
scents
to
smell
good
on
Thanksgiving
day.
I
hopped
in
the
shower
and
used
it
and
I
smelled
really
good.
3
hours
later
most
of
my
family
started
to
arrived
and
soon
so
did
my
friend
and
his
son
Nathan.
Before
they
all
arrived
I
had
used
one
of
the
deodorants
that
came
with
it
and
left
it
out
in
the
open,
A
fatal
mistake.
I
started
to
chat
with
my
friend
and
Nathan
had
ran
off
and
I
thought
nothing
of
it.
Later
I
had
to
use
the
restroom
so
I
excused
myself.
When
I
returned
to
the
table,
Nathan
was
lying
next
to
the
stick
holding
his
stomach
on
the
floor.
Nathan
had
started
to
cry
and
I
looked
at
the
stick
and
it
had
a
bite
mark
into
it.
Everyone
was
around
Nathan
so
I
pushed
through
the
crowd
of
people
and
asked
Nathan
if
he
had
eaten
some
of
it
and
he
nodded
it
approval.
Nathan
then
started
to
seize
and
911
was
called.
They
arrived
and
his
friend
explained
that
his
son
had
eaten
a
part
of
the
deodorant
and
felt
horrible
and
started
to
seize.
My
friend
and
his
son
had
went
to
the
hospital.Today
they
updated
me
on
that
Nathan
was
fatally
allergic
to
an
ingredient
in
the
deodorant
and
is
currently
in
a
coma
which
it
is
unknown
when
he
will
wake
up.
My
friend
has
blocked
me
on
all
platforms
and
is
refusing
to
speak
to
me
and
is
blasting
me
on
facebook
saying
that
I
caused
all
this
and
we
reckless
and
irresponsible
for
leaving
the
deodorant
out
knowing
that
his
son
is
fatally
allergic
to,
I
had
no
idea
that
his
son
was
allergic
to
anything.
Now
everyone
thinks
that
i'm
a
cruel
monster
so
i'm
wondering
AITA?

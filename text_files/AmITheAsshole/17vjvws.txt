My oldest son has mental health issues, (schizophrenia and psychosis)
and he can be a bit out there when he's
not on meds. He has been known to self medicate
with street drugs as well and that's never been a
good combination. For the past month and a half, he
has been off illicit drugs and taking the meds RX'd
by the doctor. He seems to be in a pretty
good place.My oldest daughter who is his big sister, is
coming into town for the holidays but doesn't want to
be around him at all. She wasn't here while he
was going through all of this but has heard about
it, while it was happening from family members. She says
she would like to just stop in at the house
and get a plate of food and then have everyone
except for him come to the hotel to celebrate an
early Christmas, exchange gifts and play prize games (that I
plan out and pay for). I don't feel like its
fair to exclude him, especially since he is clean, following
the Dr's orders and is acting pretty much like his
old self again. I think it will discourage him and
cause him to not want to continue trying. He is
really excited to see her and doesn't know how she
feels. I told her she would have to tell him
herself, because that's between them.She says its not fair that
she is coming all the way home, paying for a
hotel and then not going to be able to spend
time with anyone.Edit: I should have also mentioned my son
is living with me and I am getting legal guardianship
of him, so I am making sure that he is
taking his meds and going to his appointments.  Both
of them are adults.AITA for not wanting to exclude him?

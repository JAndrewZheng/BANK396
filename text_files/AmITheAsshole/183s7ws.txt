I
am
a
31F.
When
I
was
a
kid,
my
parents
divorced
the
summer
before
my
6th
grade
year.
I
loved
my
dad
and
idolized
my
dad,
so
obviously
this
affected
me
greatly.
But,
when
I
would
have
to
go
to
my
dads
every
other
weekend,
fridays
nights
I
would
spend
the
night
with
my
dad
and
Saturday
nights
I
would
spend
the
night
at
my
grandmas
(his
moms)
and
Sunday
we
would
have
a
big
Italian
lunch
every
Sunday
after
church,
then
I
would
go
back
to
my
moms
that
night.
Something
I
started
realizing
was
how
much
hatred
my
dad
had
for
my
mom.
My
dad
told
me
my
mom
cheated
on
him
with
my
now
stepdad
(they
met
shortly
after
my
mom
divorced
my
dad).
My
grandma
would
even
say
the
same
thing.
So
naturally,
I
started
to
hate
my
mom.
To
the
point
where
I
was
refusing
to
move
in
to
my
stepdads
house
after
they
got
married
because
I
felt
like
he
was
the
reason
they
divorced.
Obviously,
I
did
move
into
the
house,
which
was
a
farm.
My
stepdad
had
horses
and
we
rode
them
all
the
time,
and
we
eventually
got
cows
and
chickens
and
a
pot
belly
pig
named
petunia.
My
stepdad
was
actually
very
involved
in
my
life
and
taught
me
a
lot.
So
I
started
to
love
my
life
at
the
farm,
and
began
to
hate
my
stepdad
less.
But,
when
I
would
talk
about
the
farm
and
things
I
did,
my
dad
would
order
my
not
to
talk
about
my
moms
house
around
him
or
his
family.
I
was
not
allowed
to
talk
about
my
life
at
home.
Which
upset
me
greatly.
I
then
noticed
how
much
my
dad
would
drink
and
how
it
changed
his
behavior.
My
sister
and
I
would
call
my
mom
and
tell
her
to
come
get
us
because
we
were
scared.
My
dad
would
be
paed
out
on
the
couch
when
we
would
leave.
AMy
dad
and
his
family
refused
to
go
to
school
functions,
my
graduation,
my
graduation
from
basic
training
when
I
joined
the
army.
Any
many
more
things,
because
of
my
mom.
Basically
taking
it
out
on
us
kids.
Now,
I
have
2
kids,
19
month
old
daughter
3
month
old
son.
I
live
in
my
own
house
with
my
fiancé
and
we
strive
on
a
positive
environment
for
our
children.
My
dad,
since
being
pregnant
with
my
daughter,
has
been
trying
to
come
back
into
my
life
in
a
very
forceful
manner.

Calling
me
everyday,
texting
me
all
the
time,
on
and
on
it
goes.
I’ve
kept
my
distance
for
obvious
reasons.
He
tries
to
play
the
victim
by
saying
I
am
excluding
him
from
his
grandkids
lives
and
he
hasn’t
done
anything
wrong.
A
part
of
me
wants
to
include
him,
the
other
part
of
me
is
still
hurt
and
I
think
he
doesn’t
deserve
to
be
involved
with
my
kids
because
me
having
kids
doesn’t
mean
it’s
a
free
come
back
into
my
life
card.
I
also
don’t
want
him
to
act
the
way
he
did
when
I
was
a
kid
to
my
kids.
He
acts
like
he
has
changed,
but
I
don’t
trust
him.
My
fiancé
says
I
should
give
him
a
chance
because
he
is
my
dad,
but
I
don’t
know
if
I
should.
AITA?

I (22f) don't want to invite my brother (24m) to
my college graduation. When we were teenagers, we were very
close. We would take walks together just to have time
to talk. When I was a senior in highschool (2019
to 2020 but still before covid), he told me that
he planned on stopping his classes and attending again next
year. I told him that I didn't think it was
a good a good idea since statistically people who take
a year off from classes never go back and he'd
still have pay tuition (he made this decision mid semester)
so he may aswell try. He got very quiet and
didn't say anything further.About a month later, I found out
I got accepted into my first choice university. My brother
was the first person I told and I still remember
his exact response, "I'll be here to support you when
you drop out" I was heart broken. What was supposed
to an exciting moment for me was met with an
immediate 'you are going to fail'Fast forward a few years
to early 2022. My mother and I had a huge
fight after I found out she put my name on
a credit card at a kid and never payed off
the debt. My brother ran to her aid and called
me a lying, manulative, narcissistic bitch. My mother and I
had already resolved the issue before he called me that.Last
week I told my mother that I did not want
my brother to be at my graduation. She told me
that he would be heart broken if I didn't invite
him and said that he often speaks highly of me
and says how proud he is of me. He never
said any of this to me so I told her
the things he did said and she said that it
was ultimately my choice but that it would probably end
our relationship altogether. Our relationship is already hanging by a
thread, we only talk on our birthdays and Christmas, and
anytime I think of him I only see a person
who is waiting for and expecting me to fail.Since my
brother lives with our mother, I can't just not tell
him when graduation is. I would have to specifically tell
him "you are not invited" So WIBTA?

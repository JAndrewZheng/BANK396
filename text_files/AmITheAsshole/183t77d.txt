Let
me
just
start
by
saying
that
I
actually
love
shopping
at
thrift
stores.
I
have
no
problem
with
second-hand
items.
In
recent
years
my
dad
and
my
grandma
have
become
huge
fans
of
shopping
at
thrift
stores
and
estate
sales.
So
for
the
past
few
birthdays
and
Christmases
all
of
their
gifts
to
me
have
been
from
those
places.
My
issue
is
that
the
stuff
they're
giving
me
is
straight
up
trash.
Broken,
filthy,
falling
apart,
peeling,
etc.
The
only
thing
they
don't
give
me
used
is
jams
and
jellies
from
the
Amish
market
which
I
don't
eat
enough
of
to
warrant
buying
me
several
jars
of!
It
took
over
2
years
of
asking
politely
not
to
give
me
anymore
because
I
never
finish
them
and
that
it's
a
waste,
for
them
to
finally
take
a
hint.
That's
how
I
feel
about
these
thrifted
gifts
they
keep
giving
me.
They're
barely
salvageable
or
safe
to
use
in
some
instances
so
it's
a
waste
to
spend
money
on
it.
They
also
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
me
about
using
these
items
going
forward
too.
I
don't
like
gifts
with
strings
attached
like
that.
The
thing
I
find
crazy
about
it
all
too
is
that
my
dad
even
asks
me
for
ideas
for
gifts
every
year
and
doesn't
get
anything
remotely
relevant.
My
husband
and
I
always
pick
out
things
they
like
and
actually
put
thought
into
and
they
never
appreciate
it
either.
Makes
me
want
to
just
straight
up
say
please
don't
buy
us
anything.
They're
not
poor
either
by
any
means
so
this
isn't
an
issue
about
not
being
able
to
afford
to
shop
anywhere
else.
I'm
not
an
ungrateful
person
I
just
find
it
a
bit
offensive
to
keep
gifting
me
broken
crap
as
a
"gift".

(Throwaway
account
because
obviously)THE
BACKSTORY:I
(32F)
have
been
with
my
husband
“Todd”
(32M)
for
6
years
and
married
for
2.
We
met
on
a
blind
date
set
up
by
our
mutual
friends
“Jane”
and
“John”
(also
married
and
still
dear
friends).
On
the
morning
of
our
date,
I
was
unexpectedly
fired
from
my
job
-
I
almost
didn’t
go
on
the
date
but
Jane
forced
me
and
to
this
day
I’m
glad
I
went.
However
I
personally
didn’t
feel
comfortable
telling
a
stranger
I
was
fired
so
I
lied
about
my
employment
and
acted
as
if
I
still
worked
the
job
that
John
had
told
Todd
I
had.
We
had
a
great
date
and
only
a
few
dates
later
I
told
Todd
the
truth,
he
laughed
and
said
he
understood
why
I
lied
and
we’ve
been
together
ever
since.
THE
AITA:We
were
recently
at
a
tailgate
for
John
and
Todd’s
alma
matter
along
with
their
college
friends
and
partners.
Long
time
friend
“Derek”
has
a
new
partner
(known
each
other
2
months,
dating
for
1
month)
“Lisa”
who
attended.
She
seemed
sweet
although
quiet
which
I
don’t
blame
because
a
new
relationship
and
old
friendships
can
be
intimidating.
I
offered
to
split
some
wine
with
her
and
we
started
chatting
and
eventually
the
rest
of
the
group
circled
around.
Someone
asked
how
Lisa
and
Derek
met
and
they
told
their
story
and
then
asked
the
other
couples
in
the
group
theirs.
When
it
got
to
me
and
Todd,
Jane
was
a
little
drunk
and
said
“Oh
this
one’s
my
favorite,
it’s
a
doozy”.
We
laughed
and
then
dove
into
the
annoying
couple
meet
cute
story
dance,
including
my
firing
and
lie.
Everyone
laughed
except
Lisa
who
next
to
me
goes
“That’s
insane”
and
at
first
I
thought
she
meant
it
like
Jane
did.
Well,
Lisa
starts
drinking
heavier
and
much
later
in
the
day
we’re
in
the
bathroom
together
and
she
goes
“Doesn’t
it
bother
you
your
relationship
is
built
on
a
lie?”I
said
“Excuse
me?”
and
she
went
on
a
5
minute
drunken
ramble
about
how
we’ll
never
last
and
how
she’d
“rather
die
than
waste
6
years
with
a
liar”.
I
tried
to
keep
my
cool
and
said
“I
don’t
think
this
is
fair
as
you
don’t
really
know
myself,
Todd
or
our
relationship
since
we
just
met.
Let’s
just
leave
and
go
get
some
water”.
And
she
said
“You
think
your
relationship
is
so
much
better
than
everyone
else
when
really
you’re
an
AH
and
a
liar”.
I
kept
my
hands
to
myself,
left
the
bathroom,
told
Todd
I
needed
to
leave,
he
offered
to
come
with
me
and
told
Derek
“Your
girl
is
in
the
bathroom
and
you’re
lucky
I
didn’t
leave
her
in
tears”
and
we
left.
Derek
texted
Todd
later
and
apologized
on
behalf
of
Lisa
and
said
she
was
drunk
but
added
the
caveat
that
“we
should
be
careful
how
much
we
tell
about
our
first
date
cause
not
everyone
thinks
it’s
cute”.So
AITA
for
lying
on
a
first
date
from,
checks
calendar,
6
years
and
8
months
ago?

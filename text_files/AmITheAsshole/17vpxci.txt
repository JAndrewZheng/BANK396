Recently my friends figured out that my family has money.
Growing up I knew my family was well off, for
context I grew up in a nice house, I was
gifted a new car when I turned 16, had a
monthly allowance and I had a college fund that took
care of my school expenses. I was always taught to
be humble and not to brag about what I had
and in high school (I went to a public high
school) no one really cared, but in college my friends
took notice of the type of car I was driving,
how I never really complained about not having enough money
to go out, and other small things that never really
occurred to me were signs that someone was wealthy. The
big thing was when I brought my college friends to
my beach house over the summer, I thought it would
just be a fun trip for us to go on
(which it was we had a blast) but ever since
then they will not stop bringing up my families financial
situation. They started googling my family and found out what
my parents do for work, the investment properties they own
and the charity my mom sits on the board of.
They found out I have to go home for a
Christmas event that my family is sponsoring and are basically
making fun of me for it. I asked them to
stop bringing up my families money and they just say
“why if I had money I would want everyone to
know” but it just makes me feel so awkward. I
love my friends but am I the ahole for asking
them to stop bringing up my families wealth?

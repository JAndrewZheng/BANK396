I (28F) and my mother (58F) have been renting an
apartment for a couple of years. I cover half the
rent and my share of utilities, while my mother pays
the other half. However, a few months ago, my sister
(33F), Jane, along with her three kids—Amelia (12F), Liam (7M),
and Emma (3F)—migrated to the USA. She doesn't contribute to
the rent; instead, the money she earns goes toward buying
food for her children.I've been understanding of her situation, considering
the challenges she faces with three kids. The apartment, a
modest 2-bedroom unit, has become quite cramped. To accommodate Jane
and her kids, my mom sacrificed her bedroom and now
sleeps in the living room, which we've sectioned off for
privacy.But wait, there's more. My brother (35M), Bobby, also moved
in after his wife kicked him out for reasons I
won't delve into. So, I'm stressed, dealing with crowding, and
navigating a very complicated living situation.Anyway, Jane asked me for
a favor this morning. Despite my stress, I agreed to
help her with a phone call since her English is
not great. Additionally, my mom asked for aistance with some
payment-related matters. Well…I arrived home after a challenging day at
work and a taxing commute on public transportation, ready to
fulfill my promises and get some much-needed rest.Upon opening the
door, I encountered the Royal Prestige salesman. Exhausted and hungry,
I just wanted to unwind, do what I committed to,
and go to sleep. As I listened to the persistent
sales pitch (focused on selling water filters), I sensed that
my mother, who has had a negative experience with them
before, was not happy. My brother valiantly attempted to ignore
everyone, and the kids were being typical kids.Jane seemed in
no hurry to end the meeting, so I messaged her
and, when that didn't work, I directly informed the salesman
that we were not interested and needed him to leave.
I opened the door and asked him to exit.Now, Jane
is angry with me and has locked herself in her
room with her kids. (AITA)?Disclaimer: All the names are fake
for obvious reasons.

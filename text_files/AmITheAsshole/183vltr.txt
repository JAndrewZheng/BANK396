I
(19
F)
started
college
and
moved
overseas,
I
stay
in
a
student
accommodation.
On
a
cold
rainy
day
I
was
about
to
leave
my
accom
to
go
for
groceries.
A
homeless
woman
with
wet
clothes
stopped
me
by,
crying,
asked
me
for
my
change
so
she
could
afford
a
room.
I
felt
extremely
sorry
and
gave
her
my
change,
she
asked
if
I
could
give
her
more
so
she
could
book
the
room
for
more
days.
She
told
me
that
she
could
take
me
to
an
ATM,
I
gave
her
a
total
of
60
pounds
that
day.
After
a
few
weeks,
she
appeared
in
the
same
spot
and
asked
me
for
more.
I
gave
her
10
pounds,
she
asked
if
I
could
go
to
the
ATM
and
get
more.
Slightly
annoyed,
I
gave
her
20
pounds
and
told
her
that
this
is
my
last
time
giving
away
any
money.
I
thought
this
was
made
clear
but
she
kept
stopping
me
by
around
my
accommodation,
one
time
she
even
stopped
me
telling
that
she
is
asking
money
for
a
friend
and
showed
me
a
man
sleeping
on
the
floor.
As
I
was
running
out
of
money
myself
I
stopped
stopping
by
her
and
started
walking
faster
whenever
she
called
for
me.
One
day
she
stopped
me
and
scolded
me
for
not
stopping
when
she
called
my
name,
I
told
het
that
I
do
not
have
any
money
and
then
she
questioned
why
I
had
bags
full
of
groceries.
Later
I
started
seeing
this
woman
around
the
campus
and
everytime
she
stops
me
questioning
why
I
became
so
distant
to
her.
She
even
tells
me
how
bad
she
feels
for
asking
people
money,
meanwhile
making
me
feel
like
I
am
the
problem.
I
do
not
understand
why
she
makes
it
look
like
we
were
friends
and
I
dumped
her
as
this
is
a
50
years
old
woman.
I
told
this
to
my
friends
and
they
told
me
that
I
am
the
ahole
for
giving
her
so
much
money
and
then
harshly
ignoring
her
so
many
times.
Am
I
the
ahole?

I’m
25,
&
my
mom
has
been
living
over
in
Europe
for
the
past
few
years
taking
care
of
my
grandparents.
My
17
year
old
brother
&
I
along
with
our
significant
others
are
planning
on
going
to
see
her
as
well
as
travel
for
3
weeks
this
summer
abroad.
My
aunt
&
uncle
asked
for
details
of
the
trip
as
she
wanted
to
come
along
with
my
autistic
cousin
(15
years
old).
I
had
no
problem
with
this
&
gave
her
the
entire
itinerary
as
well
as
the
dates
our
flights
were
so
they
could
best
coordinate
with
our
schedule.
As
the
days
went
on
we
were
in
touch
&
it
went
from
all
3
of
them
going
to
just
my
uncle
&
cousin,
to
then
her
telling
me
I
need
to
give
her
exact
flight
numbers
because
my
cousin
can’t
travel
by
himself.
I
very
nicely
explained
to
her
that
not
only
is
there
not
enough
room
in
our
car
for
a
6th
person
(I
had
aumed
they
would
have
rented
their
own
car
if
they
were
all
coming
along,
my
mom
is
picking
us
up
from
the
airport
in
her
car),
but
I
also
expressed
how
I
wouldn’t
be
comfortable
being
responsible
for
his
safety
halfway
across
the
world
for
such
a
long
period
of
time.
Every
time
I
take
him
somewhere
to
make
him
feel
included
he
has
an
episode,
the
last
time
was
just
a
few
months
ago
&
it
was
the
worst
episode
he’s
had.
We
went
go
karting
&
before
everyone
could
even
get
in
their
go
karts
he
started
cursing
out
the
staff
because
they
“gave
him
the
wrong
go
kart
number”,
then
he
froze
in
the
middle
of
the
road
making
weird
faces
&
screaming.
No
one
was
able
to
start
the
ride
because
he
wouldn’t
get
off
the
course
for
over
30
minutes,
I
was
so
scared
they
were
going
to
call
security
or
the
police
to
physically
take
him
off.
We
finally
managed
to
get
him
in
the
car
&
home
but
the
entire
process
was
almost
2
hours.
I
told
my
aunt
about
all
of
this
when
it
happened
and
she
brushed
it
off
because
everything
ended
up
being
fine.
Back
to
our
conversation
I
explained
to
her
how
if
he
were
to
do
this
at
the
airport
&
we
all
missed
our
flight
that
would
not
be
fair
to
everyone
else.
It
is
a
very
extensive
trip
spanning
multiple
countries
&
lots
of
planning
is
going
into
it
so
my
brother
&
I
can
spend
quality
time
with
our
mom
who
we
don’t
get
to
see
often.
I
told
her
I
would
still
love
for
her,
my
uncle,
&
cousin
to
come
but
they
would
have
to
make
their
own
accommodations.
I
sent
a
long
detailed
paragraph
&
was
very
civil.
The
only
response
I
got
from
her
after
all
of
this
was
“I
see,
message
received”.
AITA?

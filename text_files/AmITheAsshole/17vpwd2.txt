Long story short my wife spent $100s on tickets for
Christmas to a big touring band I don't particularly listen
to or like. She bought a second ticket for my
dad to come (he'll know the artist, but it's not
his cup of tea at all).She was so excited to
give me the tickets and when I saw the band
I tried to act happy and excited, but I'm a
crap actor and she was expecting much more of a
reaction from me than I gave. I ended up trying
to as nicely as possible tell her that I wish
she'd spoken to me about this first before spending so
much money on the tickets. She understandably got very upset,
began to cry, and told me I could sell them
if I want...I think you get the awkward position this
kind of situation puts everyone involved in. She feels bad
about spending loads on a present she thought I'd go
crazy over, but didn't. I feel bad for getting such
an expensive present (which I know loads of other true
fans of the band would unalive for), but don't particularly
want to go see the band.AITA for being open about
this with her, or should I have just STFU and
acted excited and pumped?**TL:DR - wife bought me and my
dad expensive tickets to a band neither of us like
or listen to. I was open about this with her
and said she should've asked first.**  Edit: Okay for
context, the band is Slash. I talk about him from
time to time as I play Gibsons too and my
best mate has toured with him in the past and
knows him. That said, I don't listen to his music
but can appreciate what he's achieved.

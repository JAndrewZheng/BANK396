The
university
I
go
to
is
around
2
hours
away
from
home.
Growing
up,
I’ve
always
been
abused
by
my
older
sibling.
My
parents
refused
to
do
anything
about
it
and
even
made
excuses
for
him.
Again
and
again
they
chose
my
sibling
over
me.
An
incident
happened
recently,
my
dad
broke
his
promise
to
me
just
so
he
could
choose
my
sibling
over
me
again.
I
got
really
angry
and
went
back
to
my
dorm
by
myself,
usually
my
dad
would
drive
me.
I’ve
been
ignoring
all
of
their
texts
and
calls
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now,
they
even
drove
to
my
dorm
a
few
times
to
give
me
dinner
or
attempt
to
take
me
out
for
dinner.I
didn’t
want
to
see
them
so
I
didn’t
open
the
dorm
gates
for
them
-
I
didn’t
reply
nor
read
any
of
their
texts.
While
I’m
angry
at
them,
I
also
feel
like
I’m
the
worst
person
ever
because
they
drove
2
hours
here
to
see
me,
wait
over
2
hours
by
the
dorm
gates
hoping
that
I
would
come
and
open
it
for
them,
then
drive
another
2
hours
back
home
when
all
they
got
in
response
was
silence.
I’m
feeling
so
conflicted.
A
close
friend
of
mine
who
knows
what
happened
at
home
tells
me
that
I’m
too
mean
to
them.
AITA?

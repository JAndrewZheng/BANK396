I
(27f)
am
expecting
my
first
child
with
my
husband
"Joel"
(28m).
I'm
currently
7
months
pregnant,
and
the
baby
has
begun
kicking
very
frequently.
To
be
honest,
it
hurts
and
does
not
feel
nearly
as
"magical"
as
other
people
make
it
out
to
be.Coupled
with
nausea,
this
has
been
a
tough
time
physically
but
I've
been
trying
for
this
to
not
affect
my
attitude
towards
other
people.
Lately,
my
MIL
(52f)
has
been
visiting
to
help
me
and
my
husband
out
with
preparing
for
the
baby
and
other
things.I
truly
appreciate
her
support
but
MIL
has
a
tendency
to
touch
my
stomach
in
order
to
feel
the
baby
kick,
and
try
to
make
the
baby
kick
by
shaking
my
stomach.
This
makes
my
nausea
worse,
and
just
makes
me
feel
overstimulated
from
the
constant
touching.
I've
tried
to
talk
to
both
my
MIL
and
husband
about
this
issue
to
get
her
to
tone
down
the
touching
but
they
both
have
brushed
me
off.Yesterday,
MIL
came
to
drop
off
some
food
from
Thanksgiving
since
we
spent
it
at
home
and
after
getting
the
food
into
the
food,
MIL
became
touching
my
belly
and
then
shaking
because
the
baby
wouldn't
kick.MIL
was
talking
about
how
the
baby
was
clearly
more
like
my
husband
for
refusing
to
kick
and
Joel
was
agreeing
and
joking
about
the
baby
being
a
mini
him.
By
now,
I
was
started
to
feel
nauseated
and
did
a
dry
heave
which
they
seemed
to
not
notice.
I
asked
her
to
stop
so
I
could
try
to
get
rid
of
my
nausea,
but
my
MIL
ignored
me
and
gave
my
belly
another
shake.
I
sorta
snapped
and
told
her
to
"
stop
fing
touching
my
belly."
my
MIL
looked
shocked
and
offended
by
what
I
said,
and
Joel
came
in,
comforting
her
by
shaking
it
was
just
my
pregnancy
hormones
and
I
was
acting
a
little
crazy
due
to
them.my
MIL
chose
to
leave
shortly
after
that,
and
Joel
scolded
me
for
snapping
at
his
mother
when
we
getting
ready
to
go
to
sleep.To
make
matters
worse,
Joel
told
his
sister
and
she
told
me
in
a
text
that
what
I
did
was
unnecessary
and
it
was
normal
for
grandparents
to
want
to
feel
their
grandkids
kick.
She
has
kids
herself.So
am
I
the
ahole
for
snapping
at
her?
I
feel
like
not
wanting
for
her
to
touch
me
is
understandable,
but
I
could've
been
nicer
about
it.

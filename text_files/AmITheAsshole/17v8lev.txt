I (26f) live with my boyfriend (28m). I do all
our laundry because I wfh and can take 5 mins
here and there to load the washer/switch to dryer/fold. My
boyfriend has to leave the house to work. I don’t
know if this is a him thing but he takes
off his clothes SO weird. For example, one or both
arms will be inside out, the shirts will be rolled
and somehow they end up in knots frequently. His socks
are always scrunched up too so they never actually get
thoroughly cleaned. I have asked him several times to please
at least make his clothes are all inside out or
all right side out before he puts them in the
hamper. It takes me much longer to do his clothes
than mine because 1) the balled up shirts don’t end
up drying as quickly as the other ones and 2)
having to unwind his clothes takes a while. Maybe this
is petty but I started folding his clothes the way
they come out of the dryer. I don’t have time
to stand there and figure out how to untangle his
shirts. It also makes me irrationally angry when I have
to do it. Like I dread folding it if I
know a lot of his shirts made it into that
load. I also stopped folding his socks because they are
gross and still covered in dog hair. He noticed and
is upset because now his clothes are super wrinkly. I
said I didn’t care because i’m doing him a favor
and that y he least he could do is make
sure his shirts are “normal” when they get put into
the hamper.AITA?

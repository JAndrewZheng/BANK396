Last Saturday, we had a few friends. It was 3
couples and us. We all have kids.I am from a
country that doesn't make a different meal for kids. The
kids eat exactly the same as adults, only in a
smaller portion and pre cut if necessary. 2 of the
3 couples are also from the same country as we
met in German cla. One of the couples we met
at an event.So o asked everyone if there were allergies,restrictions,
 no go's, etc. I had to keep in mind
for dinner. They all said no, everything was "normal."When they
arrived, we had a good time until dinner was served.
Let's call the couple we met at the event Lena
and Leon. It all stared with lena saying the kids
should eat beforehand. I said that the food was not
done. Then we started serving the food. We put the
kids' portion in those colorfully ikea bowls and put them
down.Lena and Leon were flabbergasted. They asked where the kids'
food was. I pointed, confused to the bowl. Leon said
that that was no kids' food. That kids' food was
nuggets, pizza, or pasta with ketchup. Their kids were crying
and started crying even harder when the other kids started
eating the food. Leon took their kids to McDonald's, and
lena said that we should adapt to this country and
eventually also left.I feel really horrible because I wanted to
be a good host. My husband said that they should
have told me if the kids were picky eaters. My
other friends say, we maybe should have done some more
research. So aita for not making food for kids ?Edit:
we are Colombian and live in germany

This
is
a
long
one
so
buckle
up.
My
childhood
friend
(23y)
has
had
ongoing
problems
with
her
parent
and
sibling
since
I’ve
known
her
&
doesn’t
have
much
other
family
that
live
conveniently
close
by
like
I
do.
As
of
late
she
has
asked
to
stay
at
my
house
every
Friday-Sunday
to
minimize
her
time
at
home
and
avoid
fights
(probably
until
she
can
move
out
in
2-3
years
minimum).
The
problem
is
there
is
no
end
date
in
sight.
I
am
also
23y,
i
have
a
car,
I’m
in
grad
school
and
live
w
my
mom
in
a
2
bedroom.
When
she
stays
over
she
stays
in
my
double
bed
w
me
in
my
room
and
i
have
to
drop
her
home
as
she
doesn’t
have
a
car.
For
context,
she
&
I
fell
out
for
a
few
months
this
summer
bc
she
has
a
long
history
of
imposing
&
being
inconsiderate
&
I
set
personal
boundaries
for
myself
which
she
didn’t
like.
My
intolerance
and
unwillingness
to
bend
over
backwards
caused
a
rift.
it
was
a
build
up
of
things:
-
I’m
the
only
one
w
a
car
so
anytime
we
go
anywhere
i
drive
(which
is
fine)
but
she
ALWAYS
asks
to
make
a
stop,
no
matter
how
inconvenient
bc
to
her
its
“on
the
way”.-
she
asked
me
to
drive
her
100
mins
roundtrip
into
the
downtown
core
for
a
cosmetic
appt,
i
said
no
but
to
me
it
says
volumes
that
you
asked
at
all
-
she
asked
me
to
drive
over
3
hours
&
use
my
car
for
her
driving
test
in
another
city,
I
couldn’t
-
I
once
told
her
I
was
going
to
the
tech
shop
where
my
device
was
being
fixed,
she
asked
if
I
could
stop
at
a
busy
mall
to
get
her
a
drink.
I
said
no.-
she’ll
ask
me
to
“go
with
her”
places
that
don’t
require
accompaniment
when
really
it
is
bc
she
needs
a
ride
-
never
offers
gas
money
(not
that
i
always
need
it
but
it’s
the
principle)-
my
mom
facilitated
a
cottage
trip
w
her,
our
other
friend
&
their
moms
(6
ppl).
Her
mom
showed
up
empty
handed
with
her
aunt
who
did
not
pay
&
a
dog
without
asking
or
letting
anyone
know.
Her
mom
&
aunt
then
tried
to
claim
the
master
bedroom.
She
wasn’t
invited
on
subsequent
cottage
trips
as
a
result
(my
mom’s
decision).
When
she
found
out
that
we
had
gone
without
her
she
was
upset.
This
was
10
years
ago,
this
was
one
of
the
things
she
cited
this
summer
when
we
fell
out.-
she
got
upset
with
me
for
going
on
vacation
with
our
friend
even
tho
she
swore
off
of
the
hotel
we
went
to
&
didn’t
have
the
money
to
travel.
We
only
went
bc
our
friend
was
starting
a
new
job
so
no
time
off
&
my
travel
voucher
was
expiringI
could
go
on
but
you
get
the
gist.
She
says
ppl
aren’t
there
for
her
like
she
is
for
them
but
she’s
never
put
in
the
position
to
sacrifice
so
that
is
easy
to
say.
She
is
always
the
one
asking
for
things.
Not
to
mention
i
feel
like
i
get
no
time
to
myself
bc
I
can’t
sleep
well
when
I’m
close
to
ppl
in
bed
and
I’m
either
at
school
mon-thurs
or
sharing
my
room
with
her
fri-sun.

I
just
want
a
friendship
where
she
doesn’t
need
anything
from
me,
besides
a
shoulder
to
cry
on,
a
listening
ear
&
my
company
on
girls
nights.
I
don’t
mind
favours
occasionally,
but
within
reason.So,
am
I
the
ahole?

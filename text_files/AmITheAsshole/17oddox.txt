This happened last night between myself (M24) and my gf
(F24) of 6 months. We hadn’t been texting much throughout
the day as we were both busy and doing our
own thing. To my knowledge she was babysitting her niece
last night. I texted her around 9pm asking how she
was doing. She responded back “Last minute plans. Just left,
actually going out with [insert friends name] for a bit.”
This friend is single if that matters. We texted for
a bit and she explained that they were going to
clubs and bars until I asked “were you going to
tell me you were going out if I didn’t text
you?”To which she responds “probably not, am I supposed to?”This
led to a small disagreement/argument in which I also asked
if she lied about it being last minute plans and
planned on going out the whole time without telling me.
She finally said “I don’t feel like I should have
to tell you where I am going and if I’m
going out”To which I replied “you don’t have to do
anything, but I feel like it’s common courtesy and respectful”I’m
genuinely curious what everyone else thinks. I see it as
common courtesy to tell a SO what you’re doing or
if you’re going out drinking. I have done that anytime
I’ve gone out without her since being together without being
told. AITA for asking why my gf didn’t tell me
she was going out to the bar?

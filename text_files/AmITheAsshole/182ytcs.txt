I'm
engaged
to
my
fianc√©
Meg.
I
own
a
large
home.
Meg
spends
most
time
at
my
place
but
technically
still
has
her
own,
we
are
in
the
process
of
moving
her
in
with
me
this
fall.
Since
my
place
has
a
lot
of
room
and
Meg's
doesn't,
I
agreed
to
host
her
family
from
out
of
town
for
Thanksgiving.
I'm
going
to
be
blunt:
I
do
not
like
Meg's
family.
They
are
all
extremely
conservative,
conspiracy
theorist,
low-key
racist,
"a
woman's
place
is
in
the
kitchen"
types.
Meg
is
very
different
from
them
but
is
close
with
them.
She
hasn't
seen
them
in
a
year
so
I
agreed
that
they
could
stay
at
my
place
for
the
holiday,
because
I
can
usually
tolerate
them
enough.Wednesday
morning,
Meg's
parents
arrive,
and
things
are
fine.
A
few
hours
later,
Meg's
sister
gets
here.
I
have
a
dog
named
Lucy.
This
is
my
dog,
not
Meg's
dog
and
not
our
dog;
I
had
her
for
years
before
Meg
was
around
and
Meg
is
not
a
big
fan
of
dogs,
although
she
likes
Lucy.
I
was
in
the
bathroom
when
the
sister
pulled
into
the
driveway.
Meg's
mom
calls
to
me
and
says
"I'm
going
to
let
Lucy
out
front
to
say
hi
to
Meg's
sister"
to
which
I
explicitly
said
"no,
don't
do
that.
She
needs
to
be
on
a
leash
and
I
should
handle
her.
Give
me
a
minute
and
I
can
come
help
but
leave
her
inside."
I
know
she
heard
me
because
she
said
ok.
2
minutes
later,
Meg
comes
screaming
saying
that
her
mom
let
Lucy
outside
and
she
ran
away
down
the
street.
I
ran
out
of
the
house
and
got
in
my
car
to
drive
after
her,
but
I
could
never
find
her.
I
drove
all
around
my
neighborhood
and
adjacent
neighborhoods
trying
to
find
her
all
day
but
I
just
couldn't.
She
had
my
number
on
her
collar
but
I
was
terrified
she
was
gone
or
got
hit
by
a
car
or
something.
Meg
drove
around
in
her
car
some
throughout
the
day
too
but
her
parents
and
sister
did
nothing,
they
just
spent
the
day
alone
at
my
house.
I
went
home
and
slept
and
then
resumed
the
search
in
the
morning
on
Thursday,
Thanksgiving
day.I
continued
searching
and
got
a
call
in
the
afternoon
that
someone
found
Lucy.
I
went
and
got
her
and
she
was
a
mess;
she
had
several
bite
marks
and
was
bleeding
in
several
places.
I
think
she
got
in
a
fight
with
a
wild
animal.
I
took
her
to
the
ER
immediately
and
they
patched
her
up
and
she
will
pull
through
luckily,
but
that
process
took
a
long
time
so
I
didn't
get
home
until
Thursday
night.Today
I
was
exhausted
and
basically
locked
myself
in
my
room
with
Lucy
to
watch
her.
Meg's
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
told
me
to
be
a
man,
and
that
the
dog
was
back
and
it
was
just
a
stupid
dog
so
who
cares.
I
told
them
all
to
leave
right
now.
Meg
was
upset
and
said
they
didn't
have
anywhere,
and
I
said
I
don't
care
but
they
can't
be
at
my
home.
They
eventually
left
after
I
threatened
calling
the
cops.
Meg
left
with
them
and
texted
that
it
was
rude
for
offering
my
home
and
then
kicking
them
out,
and
they
made
an
honest
mistake.
I
felt
that
her
mom
did
not
listen
to
what
I
told
her,
and
Lucy
needs
quiet
alone
time
to
recover,
and
I
never
even
got
an
apology.
AITA?

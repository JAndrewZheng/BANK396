I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I
shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school.
I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I
don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel
and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a
lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and
trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts.
I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to
the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating
my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often,
am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop
off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know
me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older
moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad.
We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a
printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers
told me I always look like I just walked of
the set of Sex and the City.  I took
it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My
husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always
over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t
appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear
jeans or active wear. My husband is retired and rarely
dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he
had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s
all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.
 He use to love my style, but seems over
it since he retired.  So should I be dressing
more like other parents?

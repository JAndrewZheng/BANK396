My
bf
has
a
9
year
old
husky.
He's
had
her
since
she
was
a
baby,
I'm
relatively
new
to
the
mix.
I
noticed
that
he
takes
her
on
2
10-15mins
walks
per
day,
around
the
block
so
she
can
do
her
business.
She
always
looks
depressed,
she
asks
for
the
door
constantly,
she
begs
to
go
outside
and
when
we
go
to
the
door
she
gets
excited
but
he
doesbr
take
her
out.
He
also
gets
mad
at
her
when
her
begging
gets
on
his
nerves.I
told
him
that
she
needs
2-3h
of
exercise
per
day,
I've
told
him
this
many
times
and
have
even
suggested
to
go
to
the
dog
park
so
she
can
run
around.
Today
he
told
me
he's
fed
up
with
my
comments
because
it
makes
him
feel
like
a
crap
owner.
I
said
but
it's
the
truth,
she
needs
exercise.
He
said
she's
9
years
old
now
and
that
he
doesn't
give
a
crap
what
I
think.
I
said
ok
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
making
you
feel
bad
you
have
a
high
energy
dog,
she's
needs
more
exercise.
He
called
me
an
ahole
and
went
for
a
walk
with
her
around
the
block.So
AITA
for
telling
him
his
dog
needs
more
exercise
even
though
she
isn't
mine?

I
work
at
a
safeway
and
a
customer
walks
up
to
counter
order
something
they
says,
"you
probably
don't
remember
me
I'm
Mrs.
Blank"
I
continue
her
order
and
tell
her
"I
don't
like
you,
specifically
your
husband."Got
told
she
did
nothing
wrong
and
that
rude
and
embarraing
by
my
mom.For
context
when
I
was
13
in
scouts
I
was
getting
bullied
and
singled
out,
I
was
a
very
obviously
gay
kid.
The
parents
would
always
take
there
side.
And
I
would
get
accused
of
starting
it
or
causing
a
problem.
One
of
the
parents
took
me
aside
a
50
year
old
man
and
sat
me
down
in
a
room
and
kept
telling
me
to
admit
that
I
started
it
and
would
let
me
leave
until
I
admitted
that
I
had
done
something
wrong
and
had
insighted
it.
This
went
on
for
2
hours
until
I
admitted
to
something
I
hadn't
done
because
I
wanted
to
go
home
and
he
wouldn't
let
me
leave.He
never
apologize
I
went
to
another
troop
and
avoid
him
if
I
was
at
camp
and
he
was
there.So
to
say
the
least
I
don't
like
him.Am
I
the
aholes
for
telling
his
wife
that
I
don't
like
them
in
general?

I'm getting up there in age (77M) and my health
hasn't been the greatest. I suspect I only have a
few years left, so I've been arranging my will for
after my eventual paing. I'm the oldest of five siblings.
Three brothers and one sister. The oldest of my siblings
is 70 and the youngest is 59. I only have
contact with them sparingly because of big differences in values.
I don't have any children and have never been married
either.I own a small cafe where I serve drinks (coffee,
tea, non-alcoholic drinks, etc.) and small meals to go along
with it. Above the cafe is an apartment where I
live. I own the entire building as well as the
ground it is built on. Three years ago I hired
a part-timer (Lea, 16F at the time, now 19F) to
help me out. I was doing everything alone before then.
Lea has been a great help and really enthusiastic about
work. She has helped me a lot, even outside of
her work. Our bond has become pretty great and she
often refers to me as her bonus-grandpa.Because my bond with
Lea is much better than my bond with my siblings,
I intend to leave the cafe, the apartment and the
ground to her when I pa. I know she would
take good care of the cafe, and it would give
her a good headstart by already having a place to
live. I will be sitting with a lawyer to arrange
everything in regards to taxes as well.My siblings have in
recent years been discussing what they'd do with the building
after I pa. Renting it out, letting their grandchildren use
it, or just selling it have been options for them.
They will most definitely not be pleased if I leave
it to Lea instead.WIBTA for leaving my property to my
employee in my will, instead of to my siblings?

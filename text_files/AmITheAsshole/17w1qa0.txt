i got to a big SEC school, and the recommended
dress for graduation is white. although not everyone listens to
this, as it’s a big school, full of diverse people.
i have never conformed to normal dress. i made my
first piece of clothing at age 6, and the dress
i’ve found for graduation looks so similar to it, i
love it. i am graduating early. my parents say they
want me to wear something that is white but they
won’t force me to. the dress i’ve chosen suits my
style and i love it. i am going for a
colored tight and the soft red leather a-line dress with
a slight fringe at the bottom  — a claic
60s look — which has always been my style since
i was little. it shows no cleavage or anything inappropriate.
 i felt excited and confident despite knowing many may
be wearing white dresses. but as i said i’ve never
quite fit in and i love myself so who cares?my
father called me today and asked me to wear a
white dress and to pick something more elegant. he says
the dress i’ve chose is unbecoming of the “elegant woman
i am” and told me they won’t force me but
they want me to wear something different. he said it’s
just one day and these pictures last forever. but i
won’t look back at this and regret it. i’ll be
happy i was myself! just like all of my other
milestone photos where i dressed as myself. my biggest regret
is when my mother made me wear a white dress
i hated for my high school graduation because it’s not
me! i never shared the photos and don’t really care
to see them. i’m pretty sure my gown will be
zipped anyways. my parents raised me in an alcoholic household
(my father is sober now) and care immensely about appearances
and often use shame. they said they wouldn’t be angry
if i wore what i wanted but they have made
me feel ashamed. AITA if i wear this dress i’ve
chosen? should i give in and compromise despite my family
being nothing like me?

My husband moves furniture for work and comes home filthy.
He does not shower before work. He often goes to
bed without showering too (which already grosses me out). I
had breast reduction surgery 6 days ago. Today he did
not shower before coming to bed. I asked him to
shower every night while I have open wounds and he
silently gave me attitude (and did not shower). AITA for
telling a grown man when/how often to bathe?

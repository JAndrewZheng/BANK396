Me and my friend go to different universities and both
love the Timberwolves, so in September we bought tickets to
go to a game together over Thanksgiving break, the game
is on Friday the 24th at 7pm. Then recently my
girlfriend told me her families plans for Thanksgiving: Her immediate
family will be hosting thanksgiving on Thanksgiving, and her extended
family will be celebrating on the Friday after Thanksgiving (the
same day as the game) and I'm invited to both.
I told her I would be able to go on
Thanksgiving but not on the Friday after because of the
game. She's mad that I won't be able to go
on Friday and thinks I should cancel my plans with
my friend to go to the game. I think its
unreasonable of her to expect me to cancel these plans
and leave my friend high and dry, especially since we
have had tickets purchased for 2 months now, and considering
there's no way 2 months ago I could have known
her extended family would have planned for the Friday after
Thanksgiving. I feel bad for not being able to go
to both, but also don't think I deserve to be
scolded for this. Thoughts?

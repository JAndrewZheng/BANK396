My fiancé and I recently moved to a new state
pretty far from where he used to live close to
his family. We already had plans to visit them for
2 weeks in January which I’m not super stoked about,
but now he also wants to visit them for Christmas
for a few days which I wasn’t really looking forward
to bc I want to spend this Christmas with just
us this year. I like his family but they are
just very extroverted (a bit chaotic) family, and I’m a
fairly introverted person who needs space. My main issue is
that he wants to fly up there and have us
stay at their house with no car. Also their house
is full so we’d be sleeping on the separate couches
in the living room. Im not really okay with that
because his family doesn’t usually go to bed until like
2am and they also wake up at like 6 or
7 am, and they have kids that will be running
around and playing. Sleeping would not be happening. He knows
this and I offered to pay for the hotel room
and rental car and he refuses it for some reason.
His excuse is “you don’t need sleep bc we’ll be
on vacation.”  I hardly see staying at my inlaws
with no escape as a vacation. I’m frustrated bc I
feel like he won’t work with me on anything. I
obviously have the option of just not going and staying
home but then I’d be alone at a Christmas and
for two weeks in January and I don’t want that.
I’ve tried expressing how I feel about it and he
just says I’m being crazy. I’m being told I’m selfish
bc I don’t want to stay at their house 
but I feel that I’m not asking for a lot.
I feel that he isn’t even trying to do anything
to make me comfortable bc he doesn’t care. AITA?

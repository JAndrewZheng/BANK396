Am I the asshole for not wanting to play violin
at my boyfriend sisters wedding? I 17 female have been
dating my boyfriend 18 male for over a year. I
love him very much but I have been very conflicted
recently. His sister is almost a decade older than him
and has recently gotten engaged, and has planned the wedding
for 6 months time. She is trying to cut costs
where possible and I am even helping serve drinks after
the ceremony. Though this is where the issue starts. I
have been playing violin since I was young and am
fairly capable though quit a year ago as I genuinely
never had a passion for it and needed to take
a break. Without asking me though my boyfriend said I
would be playing the violin unpaid during the ceremony while
his sister would walk down the isle. I was strongly
against this as it is a lot of pressure and
i simply don’t have the skill level for it, though
no matter what I say he refuse to take no
as an answer. Furthermore he said it is really special
and everyone is very excited and it would be disrespectful
to not play. He has said some things along the
lines of losing attraction for me because of my lack
of confidence and that he would have to reconsider our
relationship if I didn’t do it. I still am set
on not playing as I am simply not comfortable and
though it Is hopefully not the case I have to
also consider the possibility that we will be separated come
the wedding, then that would force his sister to have
to find someone else last minute or have no one
at all. Am I the asshole?

My
(f30)
boyfriend
(m27)
constantly
pronounces
words
wrong
and
doubles
down
when
corrected
as
if
he’s
in
the
right
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
wrong.For
example
anything
ending
in
“logy”
he
will
emphasize
the
oh.
Instead
of
biology
he
will
say
biOH-Lojjy.
Philosophy
he
will
say
fillow-soffy.
For
years
I’ve
told
him
it
annoys
me
but
he
says
no
the
root
word
is
bio
and
philo
so
it
should
be
pronounced
like
he
does,
not
like
all
of
academia
does.I
was
telling
him
about
a
friend
at
work
and
he
changed
the
pronunciation
of
that
name
to
its
“correct”
form.
From
VJ
to
“vih-jaye”.
I
said
that’s
not
his
name
and
he
said
yes
it
is,
he
must
be
using
a
nickname
at
work.He
pronounces
the
word
bikini
as
Biggini.
I
told
him
I
particularly
hate
this
and
he
insists
that
it’s
correct
in
his
accent
and
I
told
him
his
accent
isn’t
in
any
other
words
but
he
just
doubles
down
and
refuses
to
budge
and
says
I
should
just
deal
with
it.It’s
been
5
years.
It’s
become
so
that
if
I
get
frustrated
he
will
say
he’s
hurt
by
my
reaction
rather
than
change
how
he
pronounces
basic
things.
He
always
defends
in
two
ways
1)
the
rest
of
the
world
is
wrong
and
he
is
right
2)
it’s
hurtful
that
I’m
annoyed.I
might
be
the
ahole
here-
I
lost
my
crap
today
and
called
him
a
controlling
piece
of
crap
for
refusing
to
acknowledging
that
someone’s
NAME
can
be
the
way
they
pronounce
it
and
not
what
he
thinks
is
right
or
regional
and
he
said
he’s
hurt
and
is
huffy.
He
says
I
have
temper
issues.He
does
this
about
everything
like
he
won’t
close
the
lid
of
the
toilet
when
he
flushed
because
he
doesn’t
believe
particles
fly
everywhere’s
and
won’t
believe
the
research.

Am
I
overthinking
it??
Am
I
being
insane?EDIT:
Every
comment
is
mentioning
breaking
up.

I’m
not
gonna
break
up
over
pronunciation
obviously,
just
looking
for
perspectiveEDIT
2:
we
both
have
the
same
country,
race
and
accent.
English
is
our
second
language
but
we
are
natively
fluentEDIT
3:
there
are
now
way
too
many
comments
for
me
to
ever
read
so
I
am
abandoning
this
post.
But
thanks
so
much
for
your
emotional
labor,

insights,
and
shared
frustration
of
mispronunciation.
I’ve
opted
to
apologize
to
my
boyfriend
and
will
try
to
be
less
frustrated
even
if
he
chooses
to
mispronounce
things,
because
it’s
not
a
worthy
subject
to
fight
over,
and
because
he
is
considerate
of
almost
all
my
other
needs.
I
will
remind
him
to
be
more
flexible
in
a
relationship
and
remind
myself
to
let
small
things
not
snowball.
**Getting
him
to
pronounce
bikini
right
IS
a
hill
I
will
die
on
unfortunately**,
but
biology
can
go
to
hell
I
guess.
EDIT
4:
turning
off
notifs
for
real
guys!
Thanks
though!
Sort
of!
We
made
up.

I’m a lifeguard for an indoor pool. When i got
to work there was shattered glass everywhere and to the
entrance of the pool. I cleaned up the bigger pieces
with a broom and dust pan we have in our
closest but couldn’t pick up the smaller ones due to
them sticking to the liquid and floor(In my contract and
orientation of my first day i was told to call
my manager and he would get janitors to clean it
up since they have them at the building for those
types of stuff) I also didn’t have access to any
cleaning products or equipment since we only have a closet
for chemicals and the pump room. I texted my manager
about it and he apparently called janitors to clean it
up. After an hour there was no janitor still and
a patron showed up to swim, I explained that I
had to close the pool because of the glass in
front of the door and I didn’t want people getting
cuts and potentially bringing glass inside the pool(I figured out
earlier on that glass was getting inside the deck area
due to them sticking to my shoes, i cleaned off
my shoes and sweep the area after that). About 20
min after that incident I get a text from my
manager that I couldn’t close the pool without asking him
and to just leave the glass there and put stuff
in front of the door blocking the way and a
sign warning people about glass on the floor. And shortly
after one of the HOA board members showed up and
started cleaning up. They checked the cameras to see who
it was but they couldn’t find it. After cleaning up
a bit where there wasn’t anymore glass she said it
was okay for me to close the pool and i
reopened again.More insight: The glass was in the way of
the door to get in the pool and to go
to the locker room, and people sometimes walk barefoot in
that area. I hate that this happened because I don’t
like closing the pool and it was a first time
something like this happened. If I had cleaning equipment I
wouldn’t had mind cleaning it up because I’m used to
doing that type of stuff over the summer already.

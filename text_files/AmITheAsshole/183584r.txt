My
sister
has
what
I
would
cla
as
an
“on
paper”
marriage.
Her
“husband”
Alex
doesn’t
even
live
on
the
same
continent
as
us
and
they
have
almost
zero
contact
outside
of
the
1-2
visits
he
forces
on
her
yearly
so
he
can
lord
the
fact
that
he’s
still
her
husband
over
her.We
live
in
different
cities
so
I’m
visiting
her
for
2
weeks.
Everything
was
planned
and
I’d
booked
the
time
off
work
when
she
decided
to
let
me
know
that
Alex
had
text
her
to
tell
her
he
would
be
here
during
my
visit.
I
didn’t
want
to
waste
my
annual
leave
being
around
him
and
I
knew
I
would
only
say
something
to
him
that
would
make
my
sister’s
situation
worse
so
I
asked
her
to
ask
him
not
to
come
or
to
at
least
reschedule
to
after
my
visit.
She
refused
to
because
“we
know
how
he
is”
so
she
didn’t
think
he
would
be
willing
to
move
his
visit
even
if
she
asked.I
decided
to
text
him
myself
to
ask
him
not
to
come
while
I
was
there
since
she
was
too
chicken
to
do
it.
He
left
me
on
read
but
he
did
tell
my
sister
he
may
not
be
here
when
he
originally
promised
so
I
thought
he
was
willing
to
compromise.
Boy
was
I
wrong.
He
showed
up
a
few
days
ago
and
has
been
nothing
but
a
sarcastic
nuisance
since
arriving.
He
let
my
sister
know
I
had
tried
to
stop
him
from
coming
“home”
to
“his”
house
which
is
a
lie
because
this
isn’t
his
bloody
home.I’ve
had
so
many
arguments
with
him
that
I’ve
lost
count
and
my
poor
sister
is
so
upset
and
stressed
out
over
this
which
almost
makes
me
wish
I
hadn’t
said
anything.AITA?

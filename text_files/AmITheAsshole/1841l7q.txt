Hey
Reddit,
I
(22F)
am
grappling
with
a
situation
from
Thanksgiving
that
left
me
feeling
hurt
and
angry.
I
need
your
perspective
to
determine
if
I
handled
it
appropriately.



So,
my
husband's
parents
hosted
Thanksgiving
this
year,
and
everything
was
going
fine
until
my
father-in-law
(38M)
dropped
some
truly
offensive
and
racist
remarks
aimed
directly
at
me.
As
an
indigenous
woman,
the
comments
were
not
only
disrespectful
but
downright
hurtful.



I
found
myself
at
a
loss
for
words
and
decided
to
remove
myself
from
the
situation
to
avoid
causing
a
scene.
I
left
the
house
and
ended
up
at
my
ex-boyfriend's
place
to
cool
off
and
process
what
had
just
happened.
Now,
my
husband
is
upset
that
I
left
without
saying
anything,
and
I'm
questioning
if
my
reaction
was
justified.



For
those
curious
about
the
remarks,
my
father-in-law
made
derogatory
comments
about
my
cultural
background,
insinuating
stereotypes
that
were
both
ignorant
and
offensive.
I
felt
I
needed
some
space
to
gather
myself
rather
than
engage
in
a
heated
confrontation
at
a
family
event.



So,
Reddit,
AITA
for
leaving
Thanksgiving
dinner
after
my
father-in-law
made
these
shocking
racist
remarks?
Should
I
have
handled
it
differently,
or
was
removing
myself
the
right
call?
I'm
eager
to
hear
your
honest
opinions.
Thanks!

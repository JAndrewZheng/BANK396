I
[21F]
am
home
from
college
until
tomorrow
because
of
Thanksgiving.
My
family
likes
to
play
board
games,
and
there’s
one
in
particular
called
Dune
we
wanted
to
play
this
weekend.

And
we
did!
We
played
it
yesterday.
It
was
fun.
Took
about
two
hours
and
was
a
nice
way
to
spend
the
morning.
…And
then
they
want
to
play
again.
I’m
tired
by
this
point
so
I’m
not
really
into
it,
but
the
minimum
number
of
players
is
four
so
my
presence
is
needed.
I
want
to
play
tomorrow
instead,
but
my
brother
will
have
work,
so
fine.
I’ll
do
it.
We
play.
I
lose,
as
usual.
And
everything
is
fine
until
today.
When
my
brother
apparently
*does*
have
time
for
a
game
before
work.
But
I
don’t
want
to
play
again!
We
played
twice
yesterday.
A
total
of
close
to
four
hours.
I
have
zero
motivation
to
play
again
right
now,
especially
considering
I’m
terrible
at
it.
I
say
this,
that
I
don’t
want
to
play.
But
they
can’t
play
without
me,
and
quickly
start
petitioning
me.
Look,
I’m
sorry,
but
games
aren’t
fun
when
you
play
them
over
and
over
in
a
row!
It’s
been
a
stressful
weekend
and
I
don’t
want
to
play
again.
But
they
keep
guilt-tripping
me.
I
feel
bad
because
I
don’t
want
to
upset
my
siblings,
so
I
reluctantly
go
back
to
the
table
and
sit
down.
I’m
clearly
not
happy
but
I
guess
I
*have*
to
do
this.
But
soon
my
mom,
who
is
usually
busy
with
work,
comes
to
take
my
place
even
though
she
still
has
work
to
do.
She’s
annoyed
because
she
has
to
stop
doing
her
lawyer
work,
and
makes
this
clear
to
me
too.
I
really
do
feel
bad,
and
say
as
much
as
I
head
upstairs,
and
my
dad
says
“you
should,”
which…
Anyway.
So
every
member
of
my
family
is
currently
pissed
off
at
me.
But
it’s
either
sit
there
for
two
hours
doing
something
I
don’t
want
to
and
not
having
fun,
or
nobody
else
can
play
either!
It
makes
*me*
look
like
the
bad
guy
for
setting
boundaries,
which—am
I?
Could
I
have
done
something
differently?
My
anxiety
has
been
really
bad
lately,
too,
which
has
put
me
in
a
very
overwhelmed
state,
so
I
don’t
even
know
if
I
had
the
right
reaction
or
not.
I’m
so
done
with
being
home.
[QUICK
EDIT
TO
ADD:
Forgot
to
mention
that
the
next
time
we’d
be
able
to
play
is
in
December
when
I
come
home
for
winter
break.
Feel
like
that’s
important]TL;DR:
Family
can’t
play
a
game
unless
I
play
too.
I
don’t
want
to
play
a
third
time
in
two
days,
so
I
say
I’m
not
going
to.
My
family
is
mad
at
me
for
this.
AITA?

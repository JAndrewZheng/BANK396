I (17f) met this guy (19m) online and we talked
for about a month and he asked me on a
date which I agreed to. The date went well but
as I'm coming to the end of my cert I
really need to put a good part of my time
into completing it. He keeps asking me to meet him
at the train station for "5 mins" I'm not an
idiot I know I will end up spending longer there
plus the journey there and back is at least 10
mins either way. I told that I can't see him
again until after I've completed my cert cause I'm really
far behind and he gets mad saying I'm making excuses
and if I have time to watch an episode of
a show that I like I have time to see
him. My cert finishes on the 13th of November and
I've told him we can hangout after then although he
suggested a couple of dates after this that I wasn't
free because I have my school formal and graduation and
stuff like that and then I'm going on a trip
with my friends but he still calls those "excuses" even
tho I've had these plans for a good 6+ months
and can't just cancel them for him. He says I'm
not listening to how he feels saying I'm the only
thing that makes him happy because of his family issues
but I say he's not listening to me because I've
told him multiple times why I can't see him but
have promised to as soon as I can. Who's in
the wrong?

I
am
a
stay
at
home
mom
to
Elizabeth
(4)
and
I
have
2
nieces
(2
and
3)
and
2
nephews
(3
and
4)
from
my
3
siblings,
they
all
live
close
to
us.
My
siblings
were
having
a
hard
time
finding
childcare
for
my
nieces
and
nephews
and
the
topic
came
up
of
me
watching
them.
I
have
all
4
of
them
from
8:30
in
the
morning
until
4
in
the
afternoon.
They
each
pay
me
$200
per
kid
per
week
and
they
bring
their
own
food.
Elizabeth
goes
to
preschool
in
the
mornings.
We
play
at
the
house
in
the
mornings,
walk
to
Elizabeth’s
school
at
11,
play
in
the
park
next
to
the
school
for
a
half
hour,
come
home
and
eat
lunch,
then
everyone
naps
from
12:30-2.
We
have
5
nap
mats
in
the
play
area.
Everyone
has
a
mat
and
everyone
has
a
sleeping
bag.
We
read
a
story,
I
torn
off
the
lights
and
shut
the
blinds,
turn
on
the
lullaby
music,
and
use
that
time
to
start
cleaning
up.
Now,
I
have
a
rule:
if
you
do
not
want
to
nap,
you
don’t
have
to
but
you
don’t
get
to
get
up
and
play.
You
either
sleep,
read,
or
play
quietly
on
your
mat
until
2.
My
older
nephew
has
really
been
pushing
back
on
this.
He
gets
up
every
time
I
turn
around
and
tries
to
be
as
loud
as
possible
while
on
his
mat.
I
told
my
brother
and
SIL
about
this
and
they
said
he
doesn’t
like
naps
and
to
let
him
play.
I
refused
because
if
they
think
they
can
choose
between
napping
and
playing,
none
of
them
will
nap
plus
he’ll
wake
up
the
other
kids.
They’re
saying
I’m
being
unfair
by
forcing
him
to
stay
on
his
mat
for
the
entire
1.5
hours
and
that
it’s
not
developmentally
appropriate.
I’m
considering
telling
them
to
find
someone
else
to
watch
him
because
of
this.
Aita
for
making
them
stay
on
their
mats

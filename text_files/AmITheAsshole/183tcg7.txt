I
(18F)
have
an
older
sister
(26F)
who
has
yet
to
move
out
of
our
parent’s
home.
I’m
still
in
high
school,
but
I
plan
to
live
in
college
dorms
once
I
graduate.
However,
my
sister
has
never
left.
She
stayed
at
home
and
drove
to
college
since
it
wasn’t
too
far.
I
didn’t
mind
her
at
home
for
college
since
it
seemed
logical
for
her
to
save
money.
However,
she
graduated
college
about
two
years
ago
now
with
a
Bachelor
degree
and
seems
to
have
no
plans
of
leaving.
For
two
years,
my
parents
begged
her
to
get
a
job
or
something,
which
she
always
brushed
off.
She
never
even
applied
for
any
jobs,
always
making
up
excuses
for
why
she
can’t
get
a
job.
She’s
finally
got
a
part
time
“job”
where
she
works
as
a
social
media
coordinator
for
maybe
six
hours
a
week.
I’ve
told
my
parents
on
multiple
occasions
to
make
her
get
a
job,
pay
rent,
or
just
kick
her
out
but
every
time,
they
can’t
seem
to
do
it.
My
mother
is
a
bleeding
heart,
and
my
father,
while
having
talked
to
her,
does
not
actually
set
any
ultimatums.
At
best,
he
makes
her
pay
own
insurance.
Not
only
that,
she’s
constantly
in
foul
moods
and
is
rude
to
both
my
parents
and
I.
She
complains
about
chores
or
picks
fights
over
simple
things.
Increasingly,
she’s
been
paive
aggressive
toward
all
of
us
for
reasons
I
don’t
even
know.
For
example,
during
our
beach
trip,
we
took
separate
cars
there
and
back.
When
we
had
to
return
home,
my
father
needed
to
leave
early
since
he
had
a
meeting
with
someone.
However,
my
sister
freaked
out
that
they
were
not
leaving
at
the
same
time.
She
was
making
irrational
demands
and
was
disrespectful
over
nothing.
She
even
said
her
behavior
was
crazy
later
that
day,
but
didn’t
apologize
or
say
she’d
fix
it.
I’ve
suggested
therapy
or
medication
or
something
as
she
always
tells
us
she’s
“neurodivergent”
and
that
we’re
being
ableist
for
not
accommodating
her
or
being
understanding
during
her
outbursts,
only
for
her
to
say
that
“therapy
doesn’t
work
on
her”
or
that
she
doesn’t
believe
in
medication.
At
this
point,
I’m
at
a
loss
of
what
to
do.
I
can’t
force
my
parents
to
kick
her
out
or
even
punish
her.
I
know
she
isn’t
my
responsibility
but
I
am
her
sister
and
I
do
have
to
live
with
her
for
now.
My
mother
says
I
need
to
be
more
sympathetic
to
her
since
she’s
going
through
a
rough
patch,
but
I
just
can’t
seem
to
do
it.
I’ve
lost
a
lot
of
my
respect
for
her
due
to
her
behavior.AITAH
and
what
should
I
do?

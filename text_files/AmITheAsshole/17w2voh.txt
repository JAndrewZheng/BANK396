Hi all,I 24M am moving out in a couple of
months time to a nice lot of acreage off the
grid with my 26F girlfriend. I’ve always had a love
and hate relationship with my brother until 2020. His behaviour
is disgusting and he has no care in the world
for anyone but himself.He has no respect for my parents,
cusses at my mum all time even though she buys
and cooks him food, and he works full time because
of a job she got him (he’s 21 btw). On
top of that he steals my food and refuses to
replace it so I forcefully take cash from him to
pay it back which then leads to arguments. Brags to
people that he makes more money than me, yet I
quit my job to work for myself so of course
it’s gonna be slow.He once came home early and heard
my girlfriend and I in my room going at it,
and then proceeded to send a voice memo to my
friends about it (they hate him too). Everytime his girlfriend
is over he puts a facade on and tells her
that I don’t like him because apparently I’m jealous of
him. There is way worse things he’s done and the
list goes on, but that’s all he’s done just this
year…My parents are happy for me that I’m moving out,
but they’re very against me blocking my brothers number and
never wanting to see or hear from him ever again.
He’s never allowed to know where I’m moving to and
if Mum and Dad want him around at family gatherings,
then I won’t be there.Their argument is that if he
is in trouble or dying he should be able to
contact me to which I said “I couldn’t give less
of a crap” and they didn’t like that one bit
telling me I’m selfish and that I should be ashamed…Am
I the ahole? I just don’t know anymore…

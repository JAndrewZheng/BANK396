So
me
(34
M)
has
just
walked
into
my
house
after
I
came
home
from
work
(I
work
at
Walmart)
and
I
come
into
my
house
to
my
wife
(32
F)
and
my
son
(16
M)
were
yelling
at
each
other
because
my
son
had
his
girlfriend
(16
F)
in
his
room
now
he
had
introduced
us
to
her
around
3
weeks
ago.
Now
my
wife
is
a
Christian
and
me
and
my
son
are
Jewish.
Now
we
never
were
religious
but
my
wife
had
just
began
going
to
church
every
Sunday.
And
she
has
been
slowly
introducing
Christian
ideals
into
our
son
and
newborn
daughter
(around
3
weeks).
I
later
found
out
that
she
had
hit
three
holes
in
my
son's
door
with
a
hammer
as
soon
as
I
see
this
I
confront
her
and
we
have
an
argument
and
I
kicked
her
out
of
the
house
until
she
apologized
to
our
son.

wife

out

do

house

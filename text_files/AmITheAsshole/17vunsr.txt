In December, my girlfriend and I both have 11 days
off. This is over christmas so 3 of those days
will be spent with family so me and my gf
will not be together. The remaining 8 days we will
both be at home. My girlfriend mentioned going on holiday
for the week but I said I didn't want this
as I wanted some time to relax and recharge at
home during the time off and catch up on reading,
watching tv and playing video games etc. She then suggested
going away for 3-4 nights and then going on days
out for the remaining days. I pointed out that this
still wouldn't give me any time ro recahrge since we'd
constantly be budy. She said I could relax on the
evenings after the days out but I mentioned that that
would just be recharging from the day instead of actual
relaxation. I said we could do 1 or the other
so I'd happily go on 3-4 days out if I
could spend 3-4 days relaxing or I'd happily go away
for 3-4 ights if I could spend the remaining days
relaxing. She refused this and said she's already offered a
compromise. I pointed out it wasn't actually a compromise since
she is still expecting to dictate exactly what we do
over the break while only allowing me to do what
I want whereas my offer gives us both what we
want. She just said I was being unreasonable for wasting
my time off but I just said I wasn't wating
it at all. She said I wasn't considering what she
wants but I just mentioned that I was considering it
since I have offered a reasonable compromise. She just said
I was being selfish since we don't often have that
much time off together and I'm not thinking of her.
AITA for not wanting to go away on all of
my days off?

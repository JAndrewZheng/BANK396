So
I
(25
M)
took
my
girlfriend
(25
F)
out
on
a
date
night.
Usually
when
we
go
out
to
eat,
some
nights
I’ll
buy,
or
some
nights
she’ll
buy.
We
don’t
really
keep
tabs
on
it,
we’re
both
pretty
good
about
offering.
On
this
particular
night
she
got
pretty
dressed
up
and
I
appreciated
that,
so
I
thought
I’d
pay
for
dinner
and
the
movie
we
saw
after.
We
got
to
the
theatre
pretty
early
and
she
wanted
to
make
a
“TikTok”
and
that
is
really
not
my
get
down,
especially
in
a
theatre
full
of
people…
so
I
told
her
no,
I
don’t
feel
comfortable
doing
things
like
that
if
she
still
wanted
to
when
we
got
home
I
would.
She
was
in
such
a
foul
mood
the
rest
of
the
night
even
though
I
payed
for
dinner
and
the
movie.
She
didn’t
act
appreciative,
she
gave
me
the
silent
treatment
and
she
acted
just
cold
to
me…
Am
I
the
ahole??
I
feel
like
I
did
nothing
wrong
for
not
doing
something
I
don’t
feel
comfortable
doing
especially
when
I
tried
to
provide
her
with
a
nice
evening
by
buying
her
dinner
and
a
movie.

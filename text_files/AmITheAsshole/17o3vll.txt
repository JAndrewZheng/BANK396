Bf (39) and I (34) have been living together for
2 years. He has 2 sons (13&11). 13 is extremely
disrespectful. After this last episode (13 saying "you can't do
anything to me. You're not my mom and you're not
going to hit me." (BF reprimanded him for that immediately))
I told BF I'm done allowing him to use my
wifi. It's the only thing that he seems to care
about because he needs it to play video games or
watch YouTube. I'm done allowing BF to use my vehicle
when 13 wants to go to the skate park with
his friends (I have more seats in my car than
he does in his truck. I usually have no problem
with him using my car as he does the oil
changes and necessary maintance). My thoughts are we've tried so
many different things to correct his behavior, and this is
what he cares about. This will be the 3rd day
without wifi for 13 and my BF says I'm being
ridiculous. If the kid can't be nice he can't use
my stuff. Am I an asshole?

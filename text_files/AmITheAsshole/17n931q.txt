I (F39) have a very insecure daughter (F14) who has
a depressingly unhealthy obsession with her looks. She often avoids
mirrors and pictures because her mood instantly drains when she
sees herself. She constantly asks her father and me if
we think she's pretty and we always tell her the
same thing, that she's a beautiful girl inside and out.
As I understand how most teenage girls are with their
body image as I was one at some point myself,
my daughter's vanity is not only becoming exhausting to those
around her, but I fear it's causing her to slowly
lose herself.Yesterday, I decided to sit her down to chat
with her about this, to discuss what's bothering her, and
to see if she's willing to visit a therapist. She
told me she didn't want to talk about it, but
as her mother, of course, I'm going to be worried
about her, so I insisted. She finally agreed.A few minutes
into this conversation, she asked exactly this, "Mom, I want
you to be completely honest with me. That means no
sugarcoating. The kids at my school think I'm ugly and
say I look like a bird because I have a
big nose. Do you really think I'm beautiful, or are
you just lying?" I'm an honest person, so I gave
her the most honest answer I had. I told her
she was average-looking like most people in the world are,
and that it's not a bad thing to have an
average appearance. She immediately got up and left without saying
a word and just went into her room for the
rest of the night.Today, she has been cold and distant,
and I think I upset her, which wasn't my intention
at all.AITA?

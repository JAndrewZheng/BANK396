My
(f38)
father
paed
away
last
year,
and
my
brother
(m35)
and
I
both
inherited
about
$100,000.
With
the
money,
both
of
us
have
paid
down
debt,
started
a
business,
and
I
set
up
IRA
and
529
accounts
for
me,
hubby,
and
our
two
small
children.
My
dad’s
side
of
the
family
is,
and
has
always
been,
somewhat
poor.
So,
my
brother
and
I
have
helped
them
out
a
bit
as
well.
For
example,
we
gave
my
aunt
(my
dad’s
sister)
$10,000,
and
paid
the
funeral
expenses
for
our
other
aunt
when
she
paed
away
last
August.
My
cousin
(the
daughter
of
the
aunt
who
died),
was
taking
care
of
my
aunt
full
time
and
was
being
paid
by
the
state
to
do
so.
She
now
refuses
to
get
a
job,
saying
she
can’t
be
away
from
her
kids
(three
girls,
all
teenagers).
She
is
not
a
single
mother
-
her
husband
(the
father
of
the
girls)
works
full
time.
She
now
messages
me
constantly,
saying
how
poor
she
is,
and
how
she
can’t
afford
to
buy
her
kids
Christmas
presents,
and
commenting
that
it
must
be
nice
for
me
to
have
money
and
be
able
to
buy
presents
for
my
kids.
My
remaining
aunt
recently
reached
out
to
me
and
suggested
that
I
give
my
cousin
more
money
so
that
she
can
buy
her
girls
Christmas
presents
and
pay
some
bills.
My
aunt
also
said
that
my
cousin
had
asked
her
to
reach
out
to
me,
because
I
seemed
to
not
have
“taken
the
hint“
when
she
had
messaged
me
herself.
I
really
don’t
want
to
give
her
money.
I
already
gave
her
thousands
of
dollars
when
I
paid
for
her
mother’s
memorial
service
and
cremation.
Plus,
I
think
she
could
easily
get
a
seasonal
job,
or
any
other
kind
of
job
for
that
matter,
and
she
refuses.
I
honestly
don’t
see
how
her
lack
of
funds
is
my
problem
at
this
point.
I
also
don’t
want
to
continue
to
set
a
precedent
that
I
am
an
ATM,
and
can
just
give
her
money
whenever
she
feels
she
needs
it.
My
aunt
and
other
cousins
say
that
a
few
hundred
more
won’t
break
the
bank.
I
want
to
add
that
my
husband
and
I
both
work
full-time,
and
although
we
can
afford
to
pay
bills
and
put
food
on
the
table,
we
are
most
certainly
not
wealthy.
So
what
do
you
all
think?
Should
I
give
her
a
few
hundred
more
dollars
to
help
with
with
Christmas?
Would
I
be
the
a-hole
for
saying
no?

Hi!
I
am
using
a
throwaway
for
this
one
as
my
husband
knows
about
my
main.So
to
start
this
off,
I
(27f)
have
been
dating
my
husband
(34m)
since
2018,
we
got
married
three
years
into
our
relationship
(2021)
and
things
have
been
going
extremely
well.
We
have
spent
four
years
of
thanksgivings
at
my
parents
house,
this
was
the
first
time
we
choose
to
spend
it
at
his
parents
house.When
we
got
there,
my
MIL,
her
mother
and
both
my
sister
in
laws
were
in
the
kitchen
all
helping
each
other
with
food.
Me
and
my
husband
went
in
there
and
talked
for
a
bit.
My
MIL
asked
me
if
I
would
like
to
help
out,
I
said
“not
right
now,
would
it
be
okay
if
I
come
back
soon
and
help
out
a
bit?”.
She
very
nicely
said
it
was
totally
fine
and
told
me
and
my
husband
to
get
us
something
to
drink
and
hang
out
with
the
men
and
kids.
My
husband
gave
me
a
nasty
look
and
said
“You’re
not
even
going
to
help?”.
His
mother
said
that
they
were
more
than
enough
people
and
she
just
asked
me
in
case
I
wanted
to
help
with
the
cooking,
but
that
they
all
managed
just
fine.
He
grabbed
a
beer
for
only
himself
and
went
to
the
living
room,
I
did
the
same
and
followed
after.I
ended
up
helping
them
with
setting
up
everything
on
the
table
as
I
wanted
to
help
out
just
a
bit.
His
mother
did
not
ask
me
to
do
this,
neither
did
my
SIL’s.
Dinner
went
extremely
well,
we
talked
a
lot
and
I
really
like
his
family.When
we
and
husband
got
in
the
car
he
started
mumbling
really
angrily
at
me,
I
asked
him
about
three
times
what
he
was
saying
before
he
blew
up
at
me.
He
told
me
that
it
is
their
tradition
that
the
women
are
in
the
kitchen
cooking,
that
I
disrespect
his
mom
in
her
own
house
by
acting
so
entitled.
We
ended
up
having
an
argument
about
this
whole
thing
and
he
has
not
stopped
insisting
on
that
his
mother
in
fact
is
offended
by
this.
I
have
not
talked
to
her
about
this,
she
did
not
tell
me
anything
about
being
offended
either.
But
I
know
his
mom
is
a
really
nice
woman
who
would
never
want
to
say
anything
bad
about
someone,
so
I
am
starting
to
think
that
maybe
I
really
disrespected
his
mom
and
she
just
don’t
have
the
heart
to
tell
me.So
AITA
for
not
following
their
traditions?
I
feel
like
I
was
an
ahole
because
helping
out
would
not
have
been
that
hard,
and
had
I
known
the
outcome
I
would
have
just
stayed
and
helped
out.Edit:
I
don’t
know
if
this
will
help
my
case,
but
I
am
working
as
a
nurse
and
had
just
come
from
a
18
hour
shift
and
directly
went
to
MIL’s
house,
hence
why
I
was
not
that
keen
on
helping
out
with
dinner.
I
could
not
get
the
day
off.
Don’t
know
if
that
is
even
relevant
or
not,
it
is
just
like
my
reasoning
behind
this.Edit
2:
I
have
seen
many
many
people
thinking
this
and
I
have
tried
responding
to
the
comments,
but
I
did
not
completely
ignore
or
disregard
the
female
side
of
my
in
laws.
I
was
sat
in
the
kitchen
talking
with
them
for
most
of
the
time,
but
I
also
went
out
to
make
small
talk
with
all
the
other
people

OK so a quick few things to note so this
makes sense. 1 - My wife and I have this
silly drawing that she done a while back which we
constantly hide in random places to be found as a
bit of a joke.2 - She is incapable of being
"unaware" of anything. If she finds out I'm trying to
surprise her with something she'll ask questions and look for
hints etc and has ruined more than one surprise during
pur relationship - she can't help herself. Same goes if
I have something on my mind and say "we'll talk
about it later" cos I need to get my thoughts
in line she'll still dig because she needs to know
for her peace of mind.3 - We have A LOT
of shit going on in our lives ATM, including a
recent international move and another possible upcoming one, my mind
has been running a million miles an hour so I
started a journal about a week ago to get my
thoughts out in an attempt to find a healthier outlet
than bottling it up. I put aside a small amount
of time to write in it every day and she
knows it is VERY private and not to be read.During
todays entry I opened up my journal and found the
drawing sitting inside the cover.  Now she could be
just trying to give me a laugh when I'm trying
to clear my thoughts and she knew I'd find it
there. But knowing her personality and inability to not pry
I can't help but think she may have read it
and it's left me a bit pissed off, but I
also think I may be overreacting, I can't imagine she'd
read it and leave evidence of doing it right in
front of my face.I don't really want to open this
can of worms if I don't have to so just
wondering how you guys see it viewing it from the
outside in?

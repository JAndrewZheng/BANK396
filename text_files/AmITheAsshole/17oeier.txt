For context, I (a vegetarian) have just had a disagreement
with the rest of my family (meat eaters)I was sitting
and playing a game whilst my dad and sister were
eating some sweets.My dad, (who knows that said sweets contain
gelatine) in poor taste, jokingly asked if I wanted some.I
said a simple no. I thought it would end here,
but he then keeps trying to involve my sister and
taunt me, saying “mmm I bet she’s jealous she can’t
have these” and “stop being silly and just eat them”.I
would have just ignored it, but my sister then tells
me that I always have my vegetarian sweets instead. Unfortunately,
although these are meant to be for me only since
I’m the only vegetarian in the house and can’t eat
gelatine sweets, both of them usually manage to eat most
of them before I have a chance.I got fed up
and left the room, explained the situation to my mum
but she took their side and defended them, even going
as far as to say that this level of sensitivity
will lead to orthorexia, its antisocial etc.But I feel that
their behaviour was antisocial?Not sure how others would react in
this situation but being an individual with autism, I can
feel very strongly in certain situations. Therefore I do feel
I’m NTA in this situation but it would be helpful
to hear the perspectives of others.

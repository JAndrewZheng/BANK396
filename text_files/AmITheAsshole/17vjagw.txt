I (32F) have been married for 7 years. I love
my husband (34M), we’re very happy aside from the fact
that he will not stick up for me when it
comes to his side of the family and I have
some major health problems.Background:I have an autoimmune disease that causes
chronic pain and fatigue while it wreaks havoc on my
digestive system and joints. His family has repeatedly called me
lazy and high-maintenance while insinuating that I’m faking my health
problems. Both to my face and behind my back. I’ve
developed a pretty thick skin and I have no issue
sticking up for myself. When people tell me “you don’t
look sick”,  I’m faking for attention, and (my favorite)
I’m just lazy, I calmly explain how an auto immune
disease works. I’m used to it. It’s fine. I have
told my husband that I need his support when his
family makes snide comments. He has told me that he’ll
work on it then he doesn’t. So in the spirit
of self-preservation started staying home when he’d visit his side
of the family every other month. It started with me
going every other time then every 4th time.  *Traveling
is difficult for me, it’s not entirely out of spite.*
It’s been 6 months since I’ve seen them now and
we’re supposed to see them again in 3 weeks. I
feel like his words will carry more weight than mine.
TBH just hearing him stick up for me would probably
be enough for me, even if they never change. But
since I’m the only one that’s bothered it makes me
wonder if ATAH.TLDR; My husband’s family keeps saying I’m just
lazy and not ill. I’m asking my husband to back
me up.

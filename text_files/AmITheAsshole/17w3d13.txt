I have this friend I’m gonna call Lee for privacy
reasons. He has a friend who I’m calling Macy. One
time my friends and I wanted to go to Dutch
Bros and asked if Lee wanted to come. He said
yes, but asked if he could bring Macy. We said
yes, since we had never met her. However, the second
she got in my car, she started being incredibly rude
to all of us. I made a wrong turn, and
she started going off saying “who taught you to drive,
I’m afraid now, let me out of this car,” all
sarcastically. I brushed it off but was pretty upset because
I had just gotten off a long day at work.
Then she called my music crapty. Mind you, I had
just met her. When we got to Dutch, there was
a long line (there always is) and she started complaining
saying “Lee if you dragged me here and made me
wait in this long a line and this drink sucks
I’m gonna be pissed” as if she didn’t invite herself
technically. My friends are pretty hardcore swifties (I’m not, but
I support) and when Macy found out she started dissing
their music taste, as if we hadn’t all just met
her. She was also making weird sexual remarks at Lee
(who has a gf and is asexual). The thing is,
Lee really likes Macy and Macy doesn’t really have any
other friends. Aside from this one interaction, I was told
she isn’t normally like this, so maybe I just caught
her at a bad time? I don’t want to form
all my judgements on someone due to one bad first
impression. Also, Macy is trans, and while I’m also non-binary
I don’t want Lee to think I’m singling her out
because of her identity. Also, I love Lee, and don’t
want him to think I hate him or anything just
because his friend is a bitch. Anyway, I just asked
that same group if they wanted to hang, and Lee
asked if he could bring Macy. WIBTA if I told
him absolutely not?

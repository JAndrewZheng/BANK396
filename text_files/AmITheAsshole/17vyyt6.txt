My gym has childcare, which is so awesome and I’m
really grateful for it. My favorite cla is a yoga
cla scheduled from 11-noon, and the childcare also ends at
noon. The cla ends with everyone on their backs, completely
silent - called shavasana. It also consistently ends a little
late, usually at 12:05. So I’ve been packing up early
so I can pick up my kids right at noon,
which requires rolling up my mat, putting on my shoes
and opening the studio doors to the noisy gym -
all of which I fear is a little distracting to
the people in the cla - they’re trying to be
present and quite their minds. You know, yoga stuff. I’m
as quiet as I can be, but still…One day I
wasn’t paying attention and the cla was running even later,
so when shavasana started and I started packing up it
was already 12:05. When I picked up my daughter, I
said sorry for being a few minutes late and the
girl said, “Yeah, we don’t do any later than noon.
So you have to be here on time.” I agreed
and said sorry again. Then a few weeks later I
pack up early and am walking over right at noon.
I have my phone on do not disturb, so I
don’t see all the calls but from 12:00-12:01 (the time
it takes me to get to the door), I have
3 missed calls. They quickly hand her off to me
and fly out the door. Definitely picked up that they
were annoyed I wasn’t there on time again. Today, I
asked gym management about it. Just asking about the conflict
between the cla end time and childcare, and whether there
was a way of having them line up better or
whether there’s a grace period for pick up. He mentioned
that the childcare workers get paid until noon and not
after, so that’s probably why they’re eager to leave. I
told him that I appreciate them and am not complaining
about them, just wanted to bring it up as awkward
situation each week.I don’t want to be a Karen and
didn’t want this to seem like a complaint to the
manager kind of thing. I just feel like an AH
leaving the cla early and an AH when I’m at
all late for childcare. So just trying not to be
an AH but probably failing 😅Edit: Just to clarify a
few points. It might be worth noting that the gym
runs the childcare and listed the yoga cla as a
cla during childcare times. The childcare is something I pay
extra for, not free. Also, I’m on time 99% of
the time. Not chronically late. This happened by accident a
few times, and only with this one cla that lets
out at the same time.

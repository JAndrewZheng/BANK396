I 26f heard my husband 40m on the phone last
night with his parents telling then he'd see them in
the morning. Apparently he made plans to go to church
with them and take the kids with him Sunday morning
and hasn't said anything to me and it's 9pm on
a Saturday night. It's not a big deal if he
goes or not but I got upset because he didn't
even let me know that he was going. He could
tell something was wrong with me because I was being
quiet and asked what was wrong. I told him it
didn't really matter and I'd get over it and didn't
want to argue but he kept pushing the issue over
and over. Finally I told him that I wish he
would have told me beforehand if he made plans for
us to go somewhere that I would like to know
ahead of time. He said he intentionally didn't tell me
because he thought I'd get mad about him making plans
and knew I probably wouldn't want to go so wasn't
going to tell me. So now my feelings are obviously
hurt because he intentionally lied to me over something stupid.
He told me I need to know too much and
shouldn't worry about it and that he doesn't want me
to go and I should just stay home. I told
him i was upset that he intentionally hids stuff from
me and that isnt healthy for a marriage and I
asked him if he was just going to load up
the kids in the morning and just leave and not
tell me anything? He didn't have an answer and just
turned it all back on me for needing to know
everything. AITA for wanting to know plans ahead of time?

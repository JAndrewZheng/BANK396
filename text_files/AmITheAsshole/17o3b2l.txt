Throwaway because he doesn't know and follows my main acc.
 Yesterday while visiting my bf of 6 months I
was going through his PC looking for some gaming clips
of his because I wanted to surprise him with a
professionally edited highlights compilation for his birthday. While I was
searching I found a file named "Security" which I thought
was weird so I clicked on it and it was
filled with voice recordings labeled with my name (as well
as other people's names), dates, and times. I listened to
one of them and it was a recording of a
conversation we had a few days ago about an anime
we both watch. The recording was very long, and he
didnt stop recording until we said our goodbyes and you
could hear the door shut behind me after I left.
I didn't know he was recording the conversation and I
was confused, so I listened to another one and it
was also the same thing, a recording of a date
we had recently and he recorded the whole date. I
started to get nervous so I took my work flashdrive
from my purse and copied many of the recordings with
my name on them. I told him I wasn't feeling
well and I needed to go home so I left,
but I noticed his phone face down nearby.  
I called my friend when I got home and told
him what I found and he said it's definitely weird
and creepy but it's really toxic and messed up for
me to have listened to them in the first place
and then stole them off his PC without discussing anything
with him, and that I acted like a crazy gf.
Honestly I just got scared and super paranoid which is
why I didn't want to confront him. I felt as
though I was in the presence of a stalker or
something, but my friend said I'm being overdramatic and jumping
to conclusions based on zero information since I never confronted
him and this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't snooping
in the first place.   I'm so conflicted now
but AITA for taking the recordings instead of directly talking
to him?

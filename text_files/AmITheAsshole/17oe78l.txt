My brother (32) and his wife (32) recently had their
first baby. The wife is a passionate vegan for probably
10 years and my brother is veg now since they
got married about 4 years ago, I think he says
his exception is honey and oysters he collects. They both
tell me it’s for animals and the earth. Despite them
having this lifestyle we get on and no major family
drama. I bought the baby some mini baby uggs for
a birth present and they looked at me funny and
the wife (mother of baby) said point blank ‘we’re vegan’.
It wasn’t too awkward after but I feel annoyed they
were ungrateful for the gift as it was pretty costly.
My other family and parents think I’m the one in
the wrong but how can a baby even be vegan?
Isn’t this something they (the baby) should decide when they’re
an adult?

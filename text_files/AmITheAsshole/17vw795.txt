Long time lurker, first time poster. You get it. So
recently, I (25F) was laid off from my job. It
sucked but wasn’t a huge surprise? I was a social
media coordinator which is not recession proof by any means.
While I’m not thrilled about it, I applied for unemployment,
got SNAP benefits, had a couple people offer to refer
me for a job, so I feel like I’m doing
well. The only thing is that the holidays are coming
up, and to me, I’m kinda bummed that my job
let me go right before thanksgiving and Christmas and everything.
I love my family, but I wasn’t too excited about
having to explain to my family over and over again
that I was laid off and what I was doing
and everything. I was going to maybe see if I
could get away with telling them after Thanksgiving, or maybe
tell some people individually. I brought this up to my
mother and she had a couple helpful suggestions, which was
great. I noted that while it’s okay if she told
my brother, and my stepdad, I would rather not share
with any other family members or anyone… for now. She
agreed. Flash forward to yesterday, I get a text from
her that basically says that my aunt and uncle were
pressing her for information about my job, and she didn’t
feel comfortable lying about it, so she told them. Now
this isn’t the first time she’s spilled the beans on
important stuff. She kind of outed me to a couple
of family members after I told her I was bi,
but that time I never gave her explicit instructions to
keep quiet about it. But this time, I did!! I
was mad, so I told her that she might as
well tell everyone now, and that there’s no point in
telling her big things if she feels like she can’t
keep them a secret. Now she’s mad that I told
her I can’t trust her and is ignoring me, and
my stepdad agrees with her and basically said because it
was family, there wasn’t a breach of trust. So, AITA?

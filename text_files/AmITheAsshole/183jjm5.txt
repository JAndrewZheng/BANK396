My
wife
(30f)
and
I
(35m)
are
coming
up
on
our
10-year
wedding
anniversary.
In
order
to
make
it
special
we
wanted
to
get
a
large
Airbnb
down
in
Florida
and
have
a
vow
renewal
ceremony.
We
invited
immediate
family
and
friends
who
have
been
close
to
us,
helped
along
our
journey,
or
that
we
wanted
to
be
closer
to.
We
all
stayed
in
the
same
Airbnb.It
should
be
noted
that
my
family
before
our
wedding
was
very
Catholic.
I
am
the
oldest
of
7
kids.
When
my
wife
and
I
got
married
they
didn't
come,
saying
that
it
was
immoral
to
come
because
we
didn't
get
married
in
the
Catholic
Church
or
that
we
weren't
ready
maturitywise
(they
can't
make
up
their
mind
which
it
is).
Thus
starts
a
10-year
long
roller
coaster
ride
of
trying
to
rebuild
a
relationship
with
them.
For
example,
our
wedding
was
in
November
and
despite
them
not
being
there
we
tried
to
be
the
bigger
people
and
decided
to
show
up
for
family
Christmas.
We
were
thrown
out,
saying
that
we
had
hurt
them.
There
are
many
more
instances
between
my
family
and
my
wife
and
I,
but
it
would
take
too
long.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
they
never
made
the
wife
really
feel
welcome
in
the
family.Things
with
my
family
started
off
immediately
at
the
Airbnb.
My
brother
(we'll
call
him
Bob)
asked
us
as
we
were
all
arriving
if
his
girlfriend
(we'll
call
her
Sara)
could
invite
her
mom
and
grandmother
as
they
only
live
about
an
hour
away
from
the
Airbnb.
We
politely
said
no,
stating
that
we
wanted
to
keep
the
guest
list
to
the
people
we
invited.
We
found
out
later
that
they
wanted
to
because
they
are
super
busy
and
can't
make
time
to
come
down
and
that
the
grandmother
is
really
sick.
He
then
continued
to
ask
if
they
could
have
a
gender
reveal
party
(Sara
was
pregnant
at
the
time)
while
they
were
here
as
it
is
hard
to
get
our
large
family
together.
For
this
one
since
the
ceremony
was
on
Saturday
and
most
people
were
going
to
be
arriving
over
the
next
couple
of
days,
we
said
if
they
wanted
to
do
something
small
that
would
be
ok.
Then
the
drama
happened.Sara
was
not
happy
that
we
used
the
word
"simple",
saying,
"Our
baby
isn't
simple".
She
was
also
not
happy
that
we
weren't
allowing
her
mom
and
grandmother
to
come.
My
wife
tries
to
talk
to
her
to
make
her
understand,
but
Sara
immediately
shuts
her
down.
Several
other
pieces
of
drama
happened,
but
after
our
ceremony,
Bob
drove
off
to
get
Sara's
mom
and
grandmother
and
brought
them
back.
My
mom
knew
and
told
us
that
she
was
not
telling
him
no
and
that,
"We
had
our
day."
My
wife
and
I
were
livid.
We
left
the
Airbnb
to
drive
back
home
and
I
didn't
say
goodbye
to
my
family.
Since
then
we
haven't
talked
much
with
my
family
except
to
text
them
how
pissed
off
we
are.
AITA?

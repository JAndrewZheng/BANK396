I 26(f) was engaged to 29(m). I decided to end
the relationship because of his extreme anger issues. He was
very sweet and charming in the beginning but when he
became comfortable about 3 months into our relationship the mask
eventually slipped.He was living with his friend and said friends
wife when we met. He informed me that he was
trying to leave the friend group and was looking to
start over. He did inform me that they were bad
people but me being a "let me find out myself
before I make a decision" person, persuaded him to let
me meet the friend group.Turns out they weren't bad. He
was a liar that held very explicit information from me.
Things that I am too ashamed to mention here. I
confronted him and them with said Information which they quickly
explained and promptly ended their friendship with him. Because of
the this, he was no longer able to live with
his friend.We are now no longer engaged and he has
nowhere to go. I have my own home which I
share with my minor child. I do not feel comfortable
letting him live here with me especially because my child
has witnessed him getting angry with me.I do feel responsible
for him not being able to live with his former
friends because I confronted them with information he told me.
I was so angry about the things he told me
they did and I wanted to defend him/ call them
out but unfortunately Hell is paved with good intentions.Edit: a
lot of you are commenting about the engagement timeframe. I
didnâ€™t know it was that crucial to the story. But
for added context. We were dating on and off again
for 3 years. We got engaged last month. I broke
up with him 3 days after the engagement.

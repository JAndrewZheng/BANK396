I am in my late 50s (female) and have two
kids. My oldest daughter is going to give birth to
her second child next month. Their father and I divorced
about 18 years ago. I was a super young bride
and did my best to raise my kids but my
husband was 12 years older than me and was an
alcoholic. Eventually, I had to go live my own life.
I ended up moving to Sedona and getting into the
spiritual community (we lived in NY). My daughter was 20
and my son was 17 when I left - they
were both off to college.I try to visit twice a
year and spend time with my kids and grandson. I’m
of a lower income bracket so I usually stay with
my daughter. I was hoping to stay for the month
next month, but my daughter told me that she strictly
doesn’t want me coming for the birth of her second
child. She said I abandoned them and that I don’t
just get to show up for the good moments. She
told me I can come in January if I want
but I’ll need to get a hotel room.I’m a little
hurt because I really try to be helpful when I
visit. I clean, I cook, and I babysit so her
and her husband can go out. I know I live
far away, but I’m not the first mother to not
live in the same state. I make sure to visit
at least twice a year and save up a significant
amount to do it. I did get a bit upset
on the phone and told her I wish she’d told
me she was holding resentments earlier. She told me that
she didn’t have a home to stay in during college
break because I just disappeared. We hung up angrily. AITA?

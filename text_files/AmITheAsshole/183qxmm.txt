Convoluted
I
know.
My
sister
and
I
have
the
same
mother,
her
father
had
a
son
in
a
later
marriage,
and
I
showed
up
in
my
mother’s
third
marriage.
So,
when
their
dad
and
his
wife
both
paed
within
days
of
each
other,
my
sister
was
there
immediately.
I
was
there
shortly
after
her
as
it
was
nearby
and
I
wanted
to
be
there
for
her.
We
were
searching
the
house
for
a
Will
or
Trust
(none
was
found)
and
I
found
current
financial
statements
for
retirement
accounts
they
each
held
separately.
Together
there
was
around
$700k.
Her
other
brother
wasn’t
able
to
get
there
for
a
few
days.
I
found
out
later
that
my
sister
withheld
the
information
about
the
retirement
accounts
from
him.
They
sold
the
house
and
split
that
50/50
but
he
didn’t
know
about
the
$700k,
and
she
took
all
of
it.
I
love
my
sister,
but
I
find
this
to
be
despicable
and
I
want
to
tell
him.
At
the
very
least,
his
mother’s
money
should
have
been
100%
his.
Also,
given
how
she
handled
it,
I
suspect
that
there
was
a
Will
and
she
hid
it.Edit:
I
forgot
to
mention
that
when
a
friend
of
hers
asked
about
how
the
estate
would
be
handled,
I
mentioned
the
retirement
funds
and
was
promptly
ask
to
not
mention
them
again.
Which
I
obviously
found
odd.
Also,
if
I’m
wrong,
then
he
would
already
know
about
the
money
and
that
it
was
left
to
her,
so
no
harm
done.

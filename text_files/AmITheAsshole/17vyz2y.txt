I was adopted into a Christian family when I was
just a kid. At the age of 8, my adoptive
parents decided to take in a mentally disabled foster child.
Since it was a newborn, no one really knew the
extent of the disability.  Growing up was kind of
tough because of this. Ever since I've been able to
make my own decisions, I've disagreed with my "sister" and
my adoptive parents' beliefs.  Here's why: My "sister" was
always the center of attention, and having beliefs forced on
you doesn't feel like true believing. (It's not like we
believe in unicorns just because they’re in a My Little
Pony commercial, right?)  This all came to a head
on my 18th birthday. They kicked me out, saying I
was old enough to make it on my own. For
the record, I was already pretty independent, earning my own
money alongside school, because there wasn’t much support at home.
They were too busy with my foster sister.  Thankfully,
I was able to stay with a friend's parents that
same day. They helped me get on a healthier path
for the next three years until I was ready to
move into my own place.  Now, I'm 33, a
guy, and doing well selling designer jewelry from Europe in
China. I also volunteer and support youth programs – things
like student exchanges, tutoring, and advice hotlines.  Sometimes, the
local newspaper mentions my work, even my name. And guess
who reads that paper? My adoptive parents.  Recently, they've
been calling, texting, and showing up at my door. 
The reason? They're in a financial bind with all the
global issues like inflation and wars. Plus, they're taking care
of my now 25-year-old foster sister. She's mentally about 5
to 10 years old, doesn’t really get social norms, and
has two kids of her own. My adoptive parents are
looking after them too since she can't.  And now,
they want me to cover all their expenses.  AITA:
So, am I wrong for not wanting to spend my
hard-earned money on them after being treated poorly for years?

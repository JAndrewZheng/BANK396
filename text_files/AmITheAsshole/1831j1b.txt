I’m
a
24F
and
had
only
been
dating
a
27M
for
about
6
weeks.
Last
Saturday
he
had
a
small
gathering
at
his
house
with
about
10
of
his
friends
there.
This
was
the
first
time
I
was
going
to
have
a
chance
to
really
spend
some
time
with
his
friends.
They
were
all
really
good
people
and
we
were
all
having
a
great
night.
At
one
stage,
I
offered
to
get
everyone
beers
out
of
the
fridge
and
when
I
crouched
down,
I
accidentally
let
out
a
small
fart.
I
was
sooo
embarraed
but
thankfully
one
of
his
friends
(female)
made
a
joke
about
her
farts
being
a
lot
worse
than
that,
so
it
kind
of
broke
the
awkwardness
and
everyone
laughed,
and
didn’t
think
it
was
a
big
deal
(thankGod)My
boyfriend,
however,
didn’t
talk
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
night.
He
barely
talked
to
anyone.
He
had
a
really
sulky
look
on
his
face.
When
everyone
left
he
asked
me
to
leave
too
and
said
he
couldn’t
believe
that
I
was
(a)
so
unmannered
that
I
would
fart
in
public,
(b)
not
apologise
to
everyone
for
farting,
and
(c)
that
I
didn’t
apologise
privately
to
him
because
I
humiliated
him
in
front
of
his
friends,
and
he
thinks
he
wants
to
break
up.

I
was
too
stunned
to
argue
but
as
I
walked
home
I
felt
he
was
being
totally
ridiculous
and
decided
I
really
didn’t
want
to
try
and
work
this
out.
He
asked
me
the
following
day
via
text
if
I
had
thought
about
what
he
said,
to
which
I
responded
‘yes,
and
I
think
I
agree
we
should
break
up’.
He
immediately
called
to
berate
me
for
being
so
selfish
and
an
apology
would
have
fixed
everything….
I
don’t
feel
the
need
to
apologise
though?!
AITA?EDIT-
since
it
has
been
asked,
I
completely
forgot
to
say
that
after
his
friend
broke
the
ice
with
her
joke,
I
said
‘excuse
me’
in
a
silly
voice
while
we
were
still
laughing.
I
was
too
mortified
that
I
was
mute
until
that
joke
was
made.
My
BF
seemed
to
want
formal
apologies.

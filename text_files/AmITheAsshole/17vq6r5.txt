Several months ago I agreed to help my sister with
her startup (I have some expertise in this area). We
agreed on a rate (friends and family discount, 1/3 my
usual rate) and that I would bill for work done
but not for casual conversations (quick questions, bouncing ideas around,
etc). I’ve adhered to this agreement, even deliberately leaving some
billable hours off the list in order to help her
out. We met this evening and she asked what she
owed me so far. I gave her the figure (17
billable hours) and she seemed unhappy. She said that she
thought I should get paid for my work but that
she wished she could feel free to talk to me
as her sister not her business consultant and have someone
to support her and bounce ideas off of without worrying
about how much she was going to get billed. I
aured her I had followed our agreement and not billed
for any casual conversations (not including meetings which are billable)
and even left some agreed upon billable hours off the
total. Her complaints made me feel like I was being
a greedy schmuck and so I agreed to take some
more off the total, although I didn’t specify how much.
After the convo, though, I felt emotionally manipulated and used.
I felt like she was accusing me of overbilling when
nothing could be further from the truth. I don’t want
to leave her high and dry but I want to
walk away. WIBTA if I ask her to find someone
else?

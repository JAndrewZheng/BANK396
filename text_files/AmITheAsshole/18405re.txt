AITA?
I
have
a
four
year
old
with
my
ex.
We
have
75/25
to
now
50/50
to
now
me
having
full
physical
custody.
She
had
twins
with
her
fiance
the
beginning
of
this
year
but
then
they
broke
up.
They’re
almost
a
year
old
now.
Im
remarried
as
well.
Ever
since
she
had
the
twins,
my
daughter
has
become
second
(or
i
guess
third)
to
her
mom.
She
comes
to
my
house
unbathed,
dirty
clothes,
no
bag
with
her.
She
claims
shes
stressed
with
twins
(I
get
it)
and
“broke”.
I
asked
how
is
she
broke
when
I
pay
her
1200
a
month
in
child
support?She
says
one
of
her
twins
has
medical
issues
and
the
other
requires
a
certain
formula
and
the
money
goes
quickly
with
all
their
groceries.
I
told
her
thats
not
my
concern
and
the
money
she
gets
is
PLENTY
to
have
our
daughter
three
weeks
out
of
the
month.
I
told
her
to
put
her
ex
on
child
support
and
she
says
he
left
the
country.
I
actually
searched
him
up
and
he
is
traveling
through
Australia…I
asked
my
ex
for
an
extra
week
then
and
she
agreed.
Our
custody
is
a
court
order
but
I
didn't
feel
the
need
to
actually
go
to
the
court
to
modify
it.
A
few
months
ago
after
an
argument
when
she
missed
pick
up
because
supposedly
it
was
too
stressful
to
put
her
kids
in
the
car
she
threatened
to
get
my
payments
increased
since
I
got
a
new
promotion.
I
knew
she
was
saying
it
to
get
me
mad
and
wasnt
going
to
actually
do
it
but
I
was
pissed
and
went
ahead
to
file
for
full
physical
custody
and
got
it.
My
child
support
was
lowered
to
600$
which
is
ridiculous
since
she
only
gets
her
once
a
week
now
which
is
now
just
one
weekend.Im
asking
if
Im
an
ahole
because
the
pay
cut
is
affecting
her
twins
life
and
shes
now
in
debt
with
insurance
and
prescription
price
and
shes
claiming
I
stole
our
daughter
from
her
because
shes
poor.
A
lot
of
people
we
mutually
know
are
saying
Im
being
a
petty
ahole.
The
money
wasnt
hurting
me
but
it
was
the
principle.
Im
starting
to
feel
bad
now
though.
AITA?

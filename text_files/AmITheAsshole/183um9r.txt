I
20f
have
a
fiance
35m
(mark).
We
have
been
together
for
about
a
year
now,
we
met
working
for
the
same
company,
me
as
a
cashier
and
him
as
a
security
officer.
Before
we
got
together
I
dated
a
guy
(20m
Jake)
for
about
5
days,
we
didn't
work
out
together
so
I
broke
things
off.
Soon
after
me
and
Mark
got
together.
We
were
still
working
at
our
company
together
when
we
began
dating
(which
was
against
company
policy)
so
we
had
to
keep
things
hush
hush,
since
I
wanted
to
talk
about
him
and
gush
with
my
coworkers
so
I
basically
made
up
a
fictional
person
whom
i
was
doing
all
the
things
i
did
with
Mark
with
this
fictional
person.
When
things
started
to
get
more
serious
with
us
we
both
decided
it
would
be
best
if
I
left
9
months
ago
.
(Also
if
I
would
have
stayed
he
could
have
gotten
fired
because
of
the
policy).

So
this
brings
things
to
last
night.
I
got
off
work
(a
WFH
job)
and
was
waiting
for
him
to
get
home
when
he
informed
me
that
we
needed
to
talk
about
some
things.
I
ask
him
if
he's
okay
which
he
says
yes,
I
then
ask
him
if
he's
upset
by
anything
and
he
doesn't
respond
to
me.
So
I
wait
till
he
gets
home.
When
he
gets
home
he
starts
to
tell
me
that
he
was
called
over
by
Jake
and
another
coworker
that
neither
of
us
know
and
was
asked
by
the
coworker
that
neither
of
us
know
and
started
telling
him
that
â€œa
girl
that
used
to
work
here
is
texting
me
bragging
that
she
is
with
a
guy,
and
is
pregnant
with
his
kid
and
is
sending
pictures
me
of
the
two
of
them
and
the
guy
looks
just
like
you!
and
Mark
said
he
doesn't
know
what
he
is
talking
about
and
walked
away
(He
was
not
shown
the
picture
nor
messages
or
phone
number
or
anything).

And
asked
me
if
I
knew
anything
about
that.
Which
I
responded
no
to
because
1.
I
do
not
talk
to
anyone
from
that
company,
2.
I
don't
have
men
text
me
at
all
3.
I
used
to
have
a
lying
problem
when
we
first
started
our
relationship
and
after
a
lot
of
talking
and
healing
(lying
was
a
coping
mechanism
with
my
abusive
parents).
I
just
don't
allow
myself
to
lie
anymore
because
I
just
can't
do
it.
And
he
didn't
believe
me
he
asked
me
if
in
any
way
this
is
my
fault,
and
I
said
no?
And
he
seemed
like
he
didn't
believe
i
was
telling
the
truth,
so
i
offered
him
my
phone
i
told
him
he
can
go
though
it
anytime
he
wants
(he
knows
my
pacode
and
his
fingerprint
is
in
my
pacode
too)
he
then
told
me
that
anything
i
said
can
be
deleted.
After
that
he
said
he
didnt
wanna
talk
about
it
anymore
and
we
both
went
to
bed
a
bit
upset.

I
asked
him
today
while
he
was
at
work
if
he
was
going
to
ask
the
guy
who
was
with
Jake
if
he
could
see
the
pictures
I
supposedly
sent
or
the
messages
and
he
said
no
because
he
didn't
want
to
give
them
any
more
ammo.

So
reddit
AITA
for
being
frustrated
that
my
fiance
won't
ask
the
man
that
I
supposedly
sent
pictures
to
see
the
pictures?

I
(39M)
recently
got
into
an
argument
with
my
wife
(28F).
She's
a
very
active
woman,
and
she
regularly
goes
to
the
gym.
I
would
join
her,
but
after
my
knee
surgery,
I
don't
feel
as
good
exercising
as
I
used
to.
She,
on
the
other
hand,
works
out
at
our
local
gym
4
days
out
of
the
week.
She
has
told
me
about
how
she
got
a
trainer
there
to
give
her
personalized
workouts,
and
previously,
I
thought
nothing
of
it.Over
the
past
few
weeks,
she
has
been
coming
home
from
the
gym
with
more
and
more
good
things
to
tell
me
about
her
trainer,
and
I
was
happy
for
her
as
working
out
is
one
of
her
favorite
hobbies.
However,
I
was
under
the
aumption
that
her
trainer
was
a
female,
until
I
found
out
a
few
days
ago
that
her
trainer
has
been
a
man
this
whole
time.
Her
trainer
is
younger
than
I
am,
and
I
know
that
my
wife
and
I
have
a
significant
age
gap.
However,
I
never
thought
'til
recently
that
my
wife
could
potentially
be
flirting
with
a
younger
man.
She
always
talks
about
their
new
workout
routines
and
how
it's
making
her
feel
healthier,
and
I
can't
help
but
get
jealous
thinking
about
all
the
time
she
spends
with
this
random
guy.
I
even
brought
up
the
suggestion
about
setting
up
a
home
gym,
but
she
told
me
she
wouldn't
get
the
same
experience.
A
few
days
ago,
I
confronted
her
about
spending
too
much
time
with
this
guy,
and
she
got
upset.
She
said
I
didn't
trust
her,
and
she
told
me
she
has
no
feelings
for
her
trainer
whatsoever.
I
personally
am
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
of
my
wife
spending
so
much
time
around
another
man,
even
if
he's
supposedly
a
professional
trainer.
I
told
her
she
either
had
to
get
a
new
trainer
(preferably
a
female)
or
leave
the
gym
entirely.
She
got
angry
with
me
and
yelled,
saying
I
was
too
controlling,
and
refused
to
comply
with
my
request.
She
has
been
paive
aggressive
towards
me
since.
AITA
for
being
concerned
about
my
wife?

I
(16f)
lost
my
parents
and
left
leg
to
a
drunk
driver
when
I
was
five.
My
maternal
grandparents
got
custody
of
me
because
my
aunts
and
uncle
already
had
young
children/didn't
have
the
time
and
money
for
a
traumatised
disabled
child.
My
paternal
half
brother
went
to
his
mum
permanently
because
our
dad's
parents
died
young
and
I
couldn't
see
him
as
much.
I
don't
remember
much
about
the
process
because
I
was
in
the
hospital
whilst
all
of
the
legal
stuff
was
sorted
out
but
it
was
difficult
and
I
really
struggled
adjusting
when
I
was
younger.
My
aunt
Mary
is
the
one
who
is
relevant.
She
has
two
children,
Derek
(13)
and
Sarah
(16),
and
we
all
go
to
the
same
school.
For
as
long
as
I've
been
living
with
my
grandparents,
she's
had
a
problem
with
their
'favouritism'.
Because
I
see
them
all
the
time
because
I
live
with
them,
Derek
and
Sarah
should
get
special
days
every
weekend
that
I'm
not
allowed
to
go
on
because
I
see
them
all
the
time.
If
my
halfbrother
visited
us
for
Christmas,
Derek
and
Sarah
should
get
to
have
friends
over
that
my
grandparents
will
look
after.
If
my
prosethetic
leg
was
expensive,
Derek
and
Sarah
should
get
equally
expensive
gifts.
Derek
and
Sarah
are
just
as
entitled
even
though
our
other
cousins
are
normal
about
things.
Sarah
and
I
are
in
sixth
form
now
and
share
a
common
room
when
we
previously
wouldn't
see
each
other
much
at
all.

I
recently
needed
a
new
leg
because
of
a
growth
spurt
over
the
summer
and
I
just
had
an
appointment
last
weekend
to
have
it
fitted.
It
meant
that
my
grandparents
couldn't
come
to
a
lunch
Mary
was
organising
because
it
was
too
long
of
a
journey
to
get
back
in
time
for
them
at
their
age.
Sarah
has
been
complaining
about
it
all
week
because
she
was
going
to
show
off
a
trophy
she
got
at
a
gymnastics
competition
for
the
school
at
a
major
competition
she
was
working
towards
all
summer.
I
get
that
it's
a
big
deal
but
she's
been
calling
me
spoiled
and
bratty
to
all
of
her
friends
and
anyone
who
will
listen.
None
of
them
really
care
but
no
one
is
telling
her
to
stop
either.
On
Friday
morning
she
was
complaining
again
during
a
study
period
because
I'll
be
having
another
appointment
on
Saturday
even
though
we're
going
to
lunch
with
her
family
on
Sunday.
She
said
that
I
needed
to
learn
that
other
people's
achievements
matter
and
I
should
learn
to
share
attention
and
stop
being
such
a
baby.
No
one
on
our
table
told
her
to
stop
and
she
was
going
to
keep
going
so
I
called
her
a
narcisstic
brat
who
wouldn't
last
a
day
in
my
life.
She
went
crying
to
her
parents
and
now
there's
been
a
bunch
of
arguing
in
our
family
over
how
involved
my
grandparents
are
with
my
cousins.
My
grandparents
are
on
my
side
but
I
want
to
know
if
they
should
be.
AITA?

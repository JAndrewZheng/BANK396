I’m (24f) a single mom to Avery (8f). We live
in a townhouse and my best friend, Sabrina (25) lives
in an identical one to ours across the street. Sabrina
has a key to our house. Avery and I were
watching a movie the other night and Sabrina stumbled into
our house, very drunk. She thought she was in her
house. I sent Avery to her room and got Sabrina
set up on the couch. Once Sabrina was settled, I
explained the situation to Avery. Our family has a lot
of heavy drinkers so Avery knows what alcohol is. I
told her that auntie Sabrina had too much to drink
so she was going to be acting a little weird
tonight. I told her to give Sabrina some space and
to not talk to Sabrina about it. The problem is
my kid is very honest. She doesn’t mean to be
hurtful but she just doesn’t understand why we don’t talk
about certain things. Well, Sabrina came over a couple days
later and Avery asked her why she was drinking. Avery
also told her that she snores a lot louder and
talks weird when she drinks. Sabrina was mortified. Later she
asked why I told Avery she was drunk and didn’t
make something up. I told her I honestly don’t know
what I could’ve made up to excuse her behavior and
the fact that she couldn’t even remember which house was
hers. She thinks I should’ve figured something out and is
refusing to babysit now (I work nights a few days
a week so she babysat for me). AITA for not
lying to my daughter about the situation?

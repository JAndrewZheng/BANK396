Hello I am new to this , so without any
wait I'll share the situation, my mom and my dad
do not get along together but have been living together
for 25 years now , now recently he left his
phone at home , so he sent someone to retrieve
the phone my mom usually sleep early at night so
she might not have heard my dad friend , so
my friend returned to my dad's office said no one
opened the door and then my dad went home ,
when he was going home he had a little accident
with a bike no major enjury what so ever ,
he got home and started blaming mom for his accident,
then he called me and started yelling at me saying
mom is lazy does not open door if she were
to give the mobile back then my accident would not
have been happen , I said if you did not
forgot your phone at home accident would not happen why
are you blaming mom ? , as she clearly did
nothing wrong , he was driving carelessly , and he
ramed into the motorbike , how come mom is to
blame for this ? I said you have gone completely
crazy and lost your  mind , if you did
not forget your phone in the first place nothing would
have happened in the first place. Ps - i am
from India my English is not that good.

The
background
could
go
on
forever
but
the
simplified
version
is.
My
mom
and
dad
had
me
(16m)
and
when
I
was
6
my
mom
was
expecting
another
baby,
my
little
brother.
She
was
7
months
into
her
pregnancy
when
she
started
to
feel
sick
and
went
to
the
hospital.
Some
tests
were
carried
out
and
it
turned
out
my
dad
had
been
cheating
on
her
and
he
paed
along
some
STDs
to
her
during
her
pregnancy.
I
remember
my
mom
losing
her
crap
on
dad
when
she
got
home
and
I
remember
how
devastated
and
scared
she
was.
My
brother
was
stillborn
not
long
after
and
my
mom
never
left
the
hospital.
She
bled
really
badly
after
the
delivery.
My
mom
kicked
dad
out
the
day
she
found
out.
My
dad's
family
(his
parents,
three
siblings
and
two
SILs)
were
disgusted
with
him.When
I
was
10
my
dad
met
and
married
his
now
wife
Kate.
From
the
time
I
met
Kate
she
had
this
attitude
of
"I
don't
know
why
everyone
is
mad
at
your
dad,
he
treats
me
well
and
shows
me
so
much
respect".
She
told
me
I
should
forgive
my
dad
and
not
carry
a
grudge
for
my
mom.
She
also
told
me
she
would
get
his
family
to
stop
treating
him
like
a
criminal.
She
never
let
the
thing
go.
Over
and
over
she
told
me
to
let
it
go.
We
clashed
over
that
so
often
and
my
dad's
family
told
her
to
go
f
herself
with
that
attitude.
She
was
like
"your
dad
has
grown,
he
treats
me
like
I
deserve
to
be
treated,
he
learned
his
lesson,
he's
a
good
man
with
me,
he
has
someone
he
loves
now
and
wants
to
have
a
happy
marriage
with".
This
was
an
ongoing
thing.Three
years
ago
I
realized
my
dad
was
cheating
on
Kate.
He
was
saying
he
was
working
through
Covid
but
I
didn't
buy
that
and
neither
did
my
family.
Hen
and
Kate
have
three
kids
together
(my
half
siblings,
I
know,
but
I
don't
care
about
them
or
see
them
as
my
family).Kate
found
out
about
the
cheating
two
months
ago.
She
fell
apart.
Then
last
month
she
found
out
we
all
knew/suspected
he
was
cheating.
For
a
while
she
was
trying
to
confide
in
me
and
I
would
just
walk
away
from
her
or
do
something
else
and
wouldn't
listen.
Then
on
Thanksgiving
we
were
all
together

with
my
family
(dad's
family)
and
she
broke
down
even
harder
because
nobody
comforted
her
or
stood
up
for
her.
That
night
she
told
me
she
thought
I
cared
about
and
loved
her
and
would
be
there
and
support
her
through
this,
because
she's
family,
she's
my
stepmom,
she's
the
mom
of
my
siblings.
I
called
her
delusional
and
told
her
if
she
ever
felt
like
I
cared
it's
because
it
was
what
she
wanted
to
think
and
not
because
I
ever
gave
a
crap
about
her.
I
told
her
she
now
knew
what
my
mom
went
through
only
less
severely.
And
that
I
guess
she
wasn't
as
special
as
she
thought
she
was
since
he
cheated
on
her
too.She
started
yelling
and
called
me
a
monster
and
told
me
I
won't
ever
see
her
kids
again
if
I
don't
be
nicer.
I
shrugged
at
her
yelling
because
it
won't
upset
me
at
all.
She
said
I
should
have
more
loyalty
to
her
and
I
had
to
hold
myself
back
because
I
really
wanted
to
call
her
delusional
again.AITA?

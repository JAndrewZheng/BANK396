Hey , I wanted to get an opinipn about a
situation that worries me    I have a
friends and she is going to have a puppy in
a few days. However I don't think she should get
a dog , here is why    \-
She lives alone in a 30m2 flat. No balcony and
no garden    \- She is a student
, so she is at her university all day ,
which mean that the dog will be all alone all
day    \- She choose to get a
Border Collie because she wanted to run with him despite
not being into running at all (or into sport) 
  \- She has no prior experience with big
dogs and sheperds dog (She have a Chihuhaha at her
parent's homes tho).    For those reasons ,
I'm afraid the dog won't be in a good place
with her. I know she loves dogs but I really
don't think she should get one right now  
 We had a fight about it. When she told
me and our friends that she reserved the puppy I
firmly remininded her that a border collie is a kind
of dog that needs tp be stimulated a lot and
that would be way easily happier in bigger place with
a direct access to a garden. I told her exactly
why I thought that it was a bad idea and
sweared that I would never forgive her if she don't
walk the dog 2 hours a day (sheperds dog NEED
to be walked) and don't do training sessions  
 I even told her the risk of getting a
dog while being in a situation (The dog could become
very lonely and stressed , which could lead to bad
baheviors such as leaking his paws , aggressivity , destruction
in the home , difficulties to hold him during walks
   But despite this , my friend sweared
that she would do everything she needs to do ,
that she thought about everything (Personally I think she didn't)
and that I'm acting like this because my dog died
recently and I'm jealous of her getting one. She thinks
that I should mind my own buisness and stay out
of this (personally I think the well being of a
dog is everyone's buisness    AITA ?

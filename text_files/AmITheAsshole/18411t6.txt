Background
:
I
(18F)
am
currently
in
my
first
'official'
monogamous
relationship
(18M).
I
have
had
several
previous
partners,
none
monogamous,
none
official.
He
and
I
have
discussed
that
while
we
are
monogamous
and
bf/gf,
it
is
casual,
not
serious,
and
that
will
not
change
anytime
soon.AITA
:
I
have
photos
from/of
previous
situationships/fwb
throughout
my
camera


roll.
NONE
are
NSFW/inappropriate/revealing.
Some
are
somewhat
intimate(?)
(ex.
Photo
of
them
sleeping
in
bed,
fully
dressed
or
us
with
our
heads
pressed
together).
I've
asked
several
friends
if
they
think
someone
not
deleting
their
previous
'whatever's'
from
their
camera
roll
is
bad,
and
I
have
gotten
a
resounding
'yes'.
They
say
it
means
the
person
is
still
attached/still
has
feelings/isn't
committed
and
are
worried
that
I
am
asking
because
my
boyfriend
is
the
one
with
photos
and
refusing
to
delete
them.
They
were
slightly
pushy
about
it,
repeating
that
it
wasn't
okay/it
was
a
red
flag,
but
agreed
to
drop
it
after
I
told
them
he
wasn't,
but
I'm
not
sure
they
really
believed
me.
If
he
did
have
any,
I
wouldn't
care,
as
long
as
they
weren't
revealing.
I
am
not
romantically
or
sexually
attracted
to
any
of
them
anymore,
and
like
my
boyfriend
very
much.
I
don't
particularly
care
about
the
photos
in
my
camera
roll,
and
don't
particularly
want
to
scrub
them
from
my
life
like
they
didn't
happen,
but
I
would
if
it
made
him
uncomfortable.
I
do
not
want
to
ask
my
boyfriend
about
it.
We
are
both
in
college,
but
he
is
a
freshman,
and
occasionally
is
insecure
about
me
being
in
the
year
above/his
friends
tease
him
about
it.

Should
I
delete
every
single
photo
I
have
of
all
of
them?
I
still
speak
to
some
of
them
(I
am
a
sophomore
in
college
and
messed
around
freshman
year),
but
I
wouldn't
say
we
are
friends.
The
ex-fwb
I
am
closest
to
is
just
someone
in
my
same
extended
friend
group
(seen
weekly,
in
groups
of
5-8).
He
doesn't
speak
to
any
of
them
(that
I
know
of)
but
knows
about
my
history
with
all
of
them.
We
have
been
dating
for
about
a
month.
AITA
for
not
deleting
the
pics
off
my
camera
roll?TLDR
:
I
have
photos
of/with
past
fwb/situationships
(none
are
even
slightly
revealing)
in
my
camera
roll,
that
I
haven't
deleted.
Current
bf
does
not
know.
AITA
for
keeping
them?

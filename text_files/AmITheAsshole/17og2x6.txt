Alright so basically, I (24f) grew up drinking raw milk
cause my parents were really into the whole homesteading thing.
They thought it had all kinds of health benefits and
was totally safe and etc. Now I know that that's
basically all BS and I'm pretty well informed on the
health risks, but I still drink it occasionally when I
can find a reputable seller cause it tastes really good
and I like it. (And yes I know that "reputable
seller" is kinda an oxymoron when it comes to dubiously
legal substances) I'll drink a small amount and make butter
out of it too. I kinda think of it like
eating pufferfish, dumb but tasty, and the only person it
could hurt is me. One of my friends (24f) found
out that I drink raw milk sometimes and got kind
of upset at me, gave me a big lecture on
the health risks and how it doesn't actually have any
health benefits and etc. I told her I appreciated the
concern but I already knew all of that and I
was gonna keep drinking it. Now she's mad and telling
people I'm a science denier and I won't listen to
reason, and she's not talking to me. AITA?

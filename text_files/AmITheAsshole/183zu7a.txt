I
called
my
long
distance
gf
of
6
years
last
night.
I
see
her
once
a
month
to
maybe
once
every
two
months.
She
was
driving
her
car.
I
asked
her
what
she's
up
to.
"I'm
driving
to
my
ex
coworkers
place
to
hang
out
with
him".
I
never
met
the
guy
ever.
I
know
nothing
about
him.
She
didn't
tell
me
without
me
asking
her.
She
was
already
on
the
way.
She
slept
on
his
couch.
She
didn't
even
tell
me
she'd
sleep
there.
Only
when
I
asked
her.
They
made
some
food
and
talked
many
hours
and
played
games.
So
all
good.
But...
I'm
quite
jealous
now.
She
said
the
problem
is
that
I
don't
trust
her
enough.
She
said:
"ok,
guess
I'll
tell
you
every
time
now
when
I
wanna
go
somewhere...
ðŸ™„"
I
think
it's
just
basic
decency
to
at
least
inform
me
about
it.
AITA
for
demanding
her
to
at
least
tell
me
about
it
or
ask
for
my
opinion?

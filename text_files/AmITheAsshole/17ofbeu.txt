My wife (27F) and I (31M) were playing Super Mario
Wonder last night and we were playing the special world,
which has higher than normal difficulty levels. We weren't doing
to great on the first world and I suggested we
go back, get some power-ups, and then come back to
it but she refused and wanted to keep trying the
level as the small versions of the characters. Well after
another 5 or 6 more times of failing she got
really frustrated and slammed the controller on her leg and
mashed the buttons pretty hard out of frustration. These were
joycons, which are already very easy to break, but they
were also limited edition ones that cost $150 for the
set and we really don't have the money to replace
them. I told her, "Please don't disrespect them like that."
She got angry put the controllers on her chair and
stormed off. We then spent some time in the morning
doing our own things and then I tried to revisit
the subject after she got out of the shower. I
apologized for getting upset but tried to tell her that
the controllers are fragile and can break easily. She responded
with, "When I game I have a tendency to throw
my hands down in frustration, I do the same when
I'm playing on pc and my hands slam into the
keyboard." I don't do that as the things I have
are a bit expensive to replace. (Now that doesn't mean
I haven't dropped my controllers unintentionally or they haven't fallen
off my desk) I feel like I could've asked her
a little nicer but  I don't like that she
mashed the controller in frustration. There are healthier ways she
could express that frustration and I even gave her the
option to go back and get power-ups multiple times.

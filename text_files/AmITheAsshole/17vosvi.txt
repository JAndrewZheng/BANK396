I live in an apartment building that is secured by
internal/external fob access, exterior callbox, and front desk staff. One
night, I was waiting for a front desk staff member
to return from a meal break in the apartment’s lobby
area when I heard knocking on the gla entrance door.
The person who knocked had a bag of food in
one hand and was holding up their phone to me
in their other hand. It was pretty obvious to me
that they were probably trying to deliver food to someone
in the building and since the front desk was unattended
at the time, wasn’t able to enter by buzzing the
front desk. But instead of opening the door for them,
I signaled for them to use the callbox to contact
the resident who ordered the food to buzz them in.
I could see that they proceeded to buzz the front
desk using the callbox but made no effort to call
the resident and kept banging on the door while yelling
at me to open the door. Soon after, a tenant
entered with their fob and the delivery person tailed them
inside and started repeatedly calling me lazy and an ahole
for not letting them in to deliver the food. They
left the food on the front desk while continuing to
call me an ahole and lazy. I responded by saying
(maybe somewhat rude) that 1) I don’t work here, and
2) they should understand I was just being careful not
to let people I don’t know into the building. They
argued that my reasoning didn’t matter and that I was
just too lazy to let them in and that I
was being an ahole and continued to taunt me as
they left. Historically, the building has experienced several incidents of
non-residents tailing inside the building resulting in several notices to
residents urging us not to let any unknown person into
the building so I was just trying to uphold a
basic safety measure. So WIBTA?

Growing up my older sibling always made sure we all
knew they felt they knew everything. I ( 26 F
) never felt like they ( 32 MtF ) appreciated
me. I felt they always saw me as I was
inferior. One day after they cane out as trans I
had a job opportunity. I was legally blind at the
time and no one else could take me in to
work. I had asked her to take me to work
and she never gave me a straight answer. It was
a substitute teaching job so I had to let them
know ASAP. Since I never got a final answer I
had to say no. My mom told my sister that
she was disappointed I didn’t t at least get a
straight answer. My sister LOST it on my mom. I
heard the fight and locked myself in the game room
feeling an anxiety attack coming on. My sister came up
and wanted to talk to me. I told her to
leave me alone and let me deal with it. She
kept trying to make me talk but I didn’t want
to. I wanted to be left alone to deal with
my anxiety the way I knew would work. Meanwhile she
told me things like “after all i’ve done for you”
and “i hust want to make sure you’re okay” but
I kept telling her that I wanted to deal with
it MY way. Finally, I lost it and screamed at
her to get out. She walked out and was down
the hall and i slammed the door. She said I
slammed it in her face but she was halfway down
the hall and facing the other direction. My friends and
family are on my side but deep down I wonder
if I did something wrong. Should I have just forced
myself to tell her what was wrong or was it
okay that I did what I did? AITA?

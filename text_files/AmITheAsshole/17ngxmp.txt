I have been in the process of adopting a child
for the past two years. It's been an emotional roller
coaster, and only a handful of close family and friends
knew about it because I didn't want to jinx it
until everything was final.  My older sister, let's call
her Emma, got engaged around the same time I started
the adoption process. Our family has been thrilled, planning for
her big day next summer. Emma's always been the type
to love attention, but I've been supportive and helped with
preparations whenever I could.  This past weekend, I received
the final confirmation: the adoption had gone through, and I
was officially going to be a mom. Overjoyed, I wanted
to tell my family in person, so I thought our
regular Sunday family dinner at our parents' house would be
perfect.  Well, as it turns out, Emma had a
similar idea. She planned to announce her wedding venue and
date at the same dinner without telling anyone.  The
dinner started, and everyone was in good spirits. Before I
could share my news, Emma stood up, clinking her glass
for attention, and beamed as she revealed her wedding plans.
Our family burst into excited chatter, and in that moment,
I felt like my news could wait until later in
the evening, or even another day.  But then, my
mom, who was one of the few who knew about
the adoption, gave me a knowing look and mouthed, "Now's
the perfect time!"  Caught up in the emotion and
encouraged by my mom's enthusiasm, I stood up and announced,
"And I have some news tooâ€”I'm going to be a
mom! The adoption is final!"  The room erupted. Half
the family rushed towards me, showering me with congratulations. But
when I looked at Emma, her face had fallen. She
excused herself from the table and didn't return for the
rest of the evening.  After the dinner, my parents
and several relatives said that while they were happy for
me, I should have waited and not "stolen Emma's thunder."
Emma texted me saying I was an asshole for upstaging
her on purpose and that I could have chosen any
other day to announce my news.  My intention wasn't
to overshadow her announcement, and now I feel torn up
about it. Emma and I haven't spoken since, and the
family is divided on whether I was insensitive or if
it was just an unfortunate coincidence.  So, Reddit, am
I the asshole for sharing my adoption news on the
same night as my sister's wedding venue announcement?

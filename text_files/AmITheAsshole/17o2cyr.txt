I (47m) went in to use the bathroom earlier this
evening and as I walked past the tub, saw my
fiancee (51f) bathing while also video chatting with her son.
She immediately got off the phone, and I just kind
of stared...then asked, were you really just video chatting with
your son while you are naked? She got upset and
said she was just showing her face, and she had
just called to check on him. I told her that
seemed really iffy and I wasn't comfortable with it.AITA for
telling her that isn't appropriate?

Recently, one of my (19F) friends asked me to drive
her (20F) to IKEA to pick up some furniture because
I have a car and she doesn’t. Initially, I expressed
my displeasure because driving her would be an extra 20
minutes out of my way to get her, but I
did agree because we are friends and it would be
nice to catch up. Also to note, there’s a public
bus that she can ride for free that goes right
from where she lives to me, but it’s a bit
slower than a car. However, right before I’m about to
leave, she mentions that she also needs to drop something
off to one of her friends. It would take another
10+ minutes of driving through the busiest part of our
city and having to wait somewhere with no street parking
available for about 5 minutes. When I expressed on the
phone that I didn’t agree to do this, she got
hostile, rudely telling me “it was just a few extra
minutes.” Well this rubbed me entirely the wrong direction because
this whole trip is me being nice, I didn’t need
anything at IKEA and we weren’t doing anything other than
picking an item up and going home, and she’s trying
to push me being nice to the limit. Here’s where
I may be TA: when she started being rude, I
turned my car around and said I think you should
find someone else and went back home. Yes, I feel
bad because I agreed to at least drive her to
IKEA and she had already ordered the item and it
was available for pickup. But I couldn’t let myself do
someone a favor who had just been rude to me.
She also never offered to pay for gas or buy
me a meal. When I texted her later about how
upset I was, she didn’t apologize or vow to be
better, but instead argued with me and made excuses for
why she acted how she did. When I did the
math, this errand would’ve taken about 3 hours of my
time and 20 miles of driving in a city with
decently bad traffic.

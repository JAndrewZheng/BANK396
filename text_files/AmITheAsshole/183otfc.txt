A
little
backstory
I
was
born
paralyzed
and
unable
to
walk
and
I
need
a
wheelchair
to
get
around.
I
mostly
use
a
power
wheelchair
and
I
have
a
spare
manual
wheelchair
when
I
can't
use
my
power
chair,
like
when
I
go
to
my
sisters
house
or
in
older
buildings
that
are
very
handicapped
accessible
and
my
power
chair
doesnt
fit.
So
Thanksgiving
afternoon
I'm
having
Thanksgiving
at
my
sisters
house
and
heading
out
the
door
and
I
go
out
to
my
garage
where
I
keep
my
manual
chair
and
I
see
my
neighbors
son
and
his
friend
playing
in
my
wheelchair
and
being
very
rough
with
(they
were
both
riding
on
it
and
they
tipped
over
backwards)
I
was
angry
and
yelling
at
them
that
my
wheelchair
wasn't
a
toy
and
that
I
needed
it
and
they
just
laughed
and
continued
playing
with
it.
So
several
minutes
go
by
of
me
trying
to
get
them
to
stop
playing
in
my
wheelchair
they
were
in
their
backyard
that
I
can't
get
to
so
I
try
calling
their
parents
to
try
and
help
but
they
don't
answer
so
I
have
to
go
all
the
way
around
the
block
to
get
to
the
front
of
my
neighbors
house.
When
I
get
to
the
front
of
my
neighbors
house
and
I'm
finally
able
to
tell
them
the
situation
my
neighbors
say
it
isn't
a
big
deal
and
I
shouldn't
be
so
angry
but
by
this
time
it's
been
several
minutes
and
I'm
supposed
to
be
at
my
sisters
house
with
food
and
I
inform
my
neighbors
that
I
need
my
wheelchair
to
go
to
my
sisters.
I
finally
got
my
manual
chair
and
I
tell
my
neighbor
I'm
going
to
call
the
police
next
time
and
my
neighbor
said
I
was
being
a
sensitive
A
hole
but
I
don't
think
I
am.
Am
I
the
Ahole?

My
girlfriend
worked
in
a
fairly
small
team
of
around
7
people.
They
all
seemed
to
get
on
well
from
what
my
girlfriend
told
me.
There
was
one
guy
who
my
girlfriend
had
to
shadow
for
a
while
when
she
got
promoted
just
so
she
could
learn
what
her
new
responsibilities
are
etc.
She
said
they
get
on
really
well.
He
was
in
a
relationship
but
apparently
spent
most
of
the
time
with
my
gf
complaining
about
her
partner.
She
told
me
other
staff
made
comments
about
him
liking
her
and
she
approached
him
to
enforce
that
while
they
were
friends,
nothing
else
was
going
to
happen
etc
and
that
it's
weird
people
are
saying
he
likes
her
when
he's
in
a
relationship.
She
said
he
understood
and
said
it
was
a
misunderstanding.
Most
of
the
team
moved
on
to
other
jobs
including
my
girlfriend
so
they
all
arranged
to
meet
up
for
drinks
and
all
invited
their
partners
except
the
guy
I
mentioned.We
all
went
for
drinks
and
he
immediately
sits
next
to
my
gf.
He
said
he
didn't
mention
the
night
out
to
his
gf
as
she'd
have
said
on
anyway
so
he
didn't
see
the
point.
He
went
inside
for
a
drink
and
came
back
with
2
shots
each
for
him
and
my
gf.
She
ended
up
giving
one
of
them
to
me
and
he
seemed
annoyed.
As
the
night
went
on
it
my
gf
had
moved
seats
to
try
to
talk
to
other
people
so
I
was
sat
talking
to
some
of
her
old
workmates
and
their
partners.
The
other
guy
then
moves
seats
to
talk
to
my
gf
and
keeps
trying
to
talk
to
her
when
she's
busy.
She
tells
him
to
wait
since
she's
talking
to
people
but
he
just
carries
on.
She's
looking
annoyed
so
I
just
tell
him
to
back
off.
He
looks
at
me
and
asks
what
I
mean
and
I
just
tell
him
it's
clear
my
girlfriend
is
busy
and
not
wanting
to
talk
to
him
yet
he
keeps
trying
to
talk
over
her
when
she's
not
interested.
He
tells
me
I've
got
it
wrong
but
I
just
point
out
the
fact
he's
been
buying
her
drinks
and
following
her
around
all
night
and
that
he
needs
to
leave
her
alone
and
I
just
say
that
I
can
see
why
he
didn't
invite
his
gf
if
this
is
how
he's
acting.
He
said
I'm
being
out
of
order
but
a
couple
of
the
other
workmates
say
that
they
think
it's
best
if
he
leaves.
One
of
the
workmates
and
a
partner
of
another
says
I
was
too
harsh
on
him
and
shouldn't
have
had
a
go
at
him
since
he
didn't
do
anything
wrong.AITA
for
telling
him
to
back
off?

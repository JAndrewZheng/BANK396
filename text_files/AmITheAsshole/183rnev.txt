WIBTA,
Hi
all,
sorry
for
the
spelling
mistake
in
advance.
I
have
a
MIL
(May)
that
once
I
started
dating
my
husband
(Jake)
was
lovely.
However,
after
a
few
years
I
started
seeing
her
being
toxic.
Using
me
as
an
example
to
her
other
children
so
I
backed
off.
More
and
more
I
saw
toxic
qualities
and
her
disrespect
towards
my
husband.
I
didn't
like
this
but
I
kept
my
distance
as
much
as
I
could.
She
didn't
like
this.I
got
happily
pregnant
and
while
we
were
building
our
new
home.
While
it
was
being
built
I
lived
with
my
parents
to
safe
the
extra
bit
of
money.
My
MIL
heard
from
a
mutual
friend
of
the
two
family's
that
I
would
remain
living
with
the
child
at
my
parents.
My
husband
being
so
tired
in
full-time
work
and
trying
tob
fiinish
the
house
in
time
for
the
new
arrival
was
approached
by
MIL
saying
that
my
mother
and
I
had
no
plans
on
having
myself

and
my
child
move
and
so
he
had
to
ask
what
was
going
on.
This
is
not
the
first
time
she
tried
starting
something
between
us
but
I
got
over
it
for
the
child's
sake.My
son
was
born
and
I
ask
MIL
for
the
family
christening
outfit.
She
made
excuses
after
excuses
until
I
had
no
choice
but
to
buy
one.
Even
though
two
years
previous
I
can
recall
MIL
saying
she
had
it
in
excellent
condition.
5
months
after
my
sons
christening
her
second
Grandson
had
his
christening.
Low
and
behold
there
was
the
family
christening
outfit.
Now
we
are
not
talking
to
her
and
she
is
playing
the
victim.
I
know
this
is
because
of
her
dislike
of
me
however
she
took
something
away
from
my
son
that
was
not
replaceable.
Not
to
mention
she
tried
telling
us
a
few
days
before
my
sons
christening
that
her
own
son
BIL
(15
years
old)
will
not
be
his
godfather
due
to
her
change
of
mind.
Here
is
were
WIBTA
comes
in.
I
am
afraid
of
MIL
using
my
son
to
hurt
us
again.
I
am
also
afraid
of
her
creating
a
relationship
with
my
son
only
to
treat
him
indifferent
and
hurt
him.
WIBTA
to
refuse
her
seeing
my
son
unless
she
changes
her
ways
and
gets
help?

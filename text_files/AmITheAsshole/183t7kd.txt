So
I'm
white
and
I'm
a
server
at
a
national
restaurant
chain
that
you've
definitely
heard
of.
Two
Friday's
ago
I
came
into
work
at
11
A.M.
and
because
weekday
mornings
are
not
typically
very
busy
it
was
just
a
bartender
and
I
operating
the
dining
room,
however
it
ended
up
being
extremely
busy.
As
things
were
picking
up,
three
Asian
people
walk
in
and
ask
for
a
table
of
four,
with
the
fourth
person
running
behind.
So
I
grabbed
four
menus
and
pairs
of
silverware,
brought
them
to
a
table
and
gave
them
waters
while
they
looked
over
the
menu.
About
5-10
minutes
after
this,
a
single
Asian
lady
walks
in
and
says
she's
meeting
three
other
people.
I
tell
her
to
follow
me
and
bring
her
to
the
aforementioned
table...
she
looks
very
confused
as
do
the
people
at
the
table.
They
didn't
know
each
other.
I
could
feel
my
face
turning
red
and
I
sat
the
single
Asian
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
restaurant
with
the
bartender,
who
said
she
and
her
friends
were
very
happy
and
sweet
when
they
got
there.
The
people
I
had,
however,
were
pissed.
They
did
not
say
it
out
loud
but
their
demeanor
said
so,
and
they
tipped
$8
on
$90...This
was
two
weeks
ago
as
I
said,
and
I
kinda
forgot
about
it
until
yesterday
because
I
guess
the
three
people
came
back
yesterday
morning
to
eat,
and
complained
to
a
manager
who
happened
to
be
in
the
dining
room.
Said
manager
pulled
me
into
their
office
last
night
and
started
screaming
at
me
about
it,
which
isn't
usual
for
them
but
they
were
frustrated
with
everything
last
night.
I
don't
feel
that
I
did
anything
wrong
if
I'm
being
honest.
It
wasn't
even
a
racial
thing,
she
was
meeting
three
people
and
three
people
were
there
waiting
on
one
person,
the
math
added
up.
I
know,
I
could've
just
told
her
to
look
around
but
I
was
trying
to
help
her
navigate
as
things
were
getting
busy.
But
the
clientele
at
this
restaurant
is
very
diverse
and
the
manager
didn't
want
these
people
to
tell
their
friends
about
it,
especially
because
were
located
right
next
to
an
Asian
restaurant
we're
already
losing
business
to.So,
AITA?

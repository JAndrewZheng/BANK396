Hi
Reddit.
A
little
back
story.
My
(29F)
stepson
(13M)
has
been
bullied
for
most
his
primary
school
life.
From
preschool
when
older
children
tried
to
urinate
on
him
in
the
stalls,
to
now
when
children
repeatedly
get
him
in
trouble
and
call
him
really
nasty
names,
including
that
he's
dumb
and
gay.
His
best
friend
turned
against
him
and
slammed
him
against
a
wall
once
and
started
choking
him.
This
friend
has
since
been
removed
from
his
life,
but
they
still
see
each
other
in
cla.
This
friend
is
deeply
troubled
and
had
a
troubled
childhood
so
far.
I
will
refer
to
my
stepson
as
my
son
from
here
on
out,
as
he
is
my
son
at
this
point.My
son
has
ADD
and
is
Dyslexic,
diagnosed
2
years
ago.
Since
hitting
puberty
he's
been
questioning
his
sexuality
(his
bio
mom
and
I
are
lesbian)
and
he's
hinted
at
being
bisexual.
Not
that
any
of
this
really
matters
tbh.
He
knows
we
love
him
as
whatever
he
decides
to
be.
Since
being
diagnosed,
the
psychologist
has
been
seeing
him
every
month
or
so
for
therapy
sessions
as
well.
She's
taught
him
how
to
deal
with
bullies
in
general.
He
made
the
mistake
of
telling
said
best
friend
(up
top)
about
possibly
being
bisexual
and
it
spread
like
wildfire
throughout
the
school.
Anyway.
The
story
today...
So
my
son's
cla
organized
a
secret
santa.
The
name
my
son
pulled
was
one
of
his
bullies
(not
the
one
that
slammed
him
against
a
wall)
that
kept
calling
him
"a
gay
thing"
and
generally
being
an
ahole
to
him.This
boy
asked
for
a
poker
set
and
the
budget
was
100
(more
or
less
$5)
set
by
the
school.
My
son
wanted
to
buy
him
a
glue
stick.
His
idea
was
to
give
the
bully
2
presents.
A
glue
stick
and
the
poker
set.
He
asked
me
to
write
the
letters
that
go
along
with
both
gifts
due
to
his
dyslexia.The
glue
stick
letter
reads:
Dear
(bully)
This
glue
stick
is
so
you
can
glue
your
mouth
shut
every
time
you
want
to
be
nasty
to
someone.
It
hurt
me
that
you
called
me
a
"gay
thing"
repeatedly.
I
am
not
gay,
and
even
if
i
was,
which
I'm
not,
I'm
still
a
human
being
with
emotions.
I
hope
you
do
better
in
the
future.
May
you
have
a
good
holiday
with
family
that
loves
you.The
Poker
set
letter
reads:Hi.
It's
me
again.
Here
is
your
actual
gift.
I
hope
you
win
every
poker
game
you
play
with
this
set.
I
wish
you
the
best
for
high
school
and
the
future.
May
you
only
receive
kindness,
happiness
and
love.
Good
luck
with
high
school!
Merry
Christmas
and
Happy
New
Year!
He's
going
to
give
the
glue
stick
first
and
then
the
poker
set.
The
boy
isn't
going
to
my
son's
high
school
next
year.
MY
mother
said
he
can't
do
that
and
he's
gonna
get
beaten
up
deservedly.
She
says
that
kids
bully
others
for
a
reason
usually.
We
had
a
big
fight
over
this.
She
thinks
the
letter
is
too
direct
and
an
ahole
move.
Am
i
and
my
son
an
ahole?ETA:
Please
note
that
my
son
will
not
see
this
kid
again.
My
son
is
finishing
primary
school
in
2
days,
when
the
secret
santa
will
happen.
We
have
normal
school
years
lol.
It
starts
in
Jan
and
ends
in
Dec
with
4
school
holidays.
The
big
December
holiday
is
coming
up
now
in
2
days
and
then
my
boy
will
be
in
high
school
away
from
this
kid.ETA
2:
I
will
be
there
picking
my
son
up
the
second
he
leaves
school.
His
cla
is
right
at
the
entrance.
The
only
interaction
he
will
have
with
the
bully
will
be
in
cla
under
teacher
supervision.
This
kid
also
goes
to
after
school
so
he
stays
behind
while
my
son
will
walk
out
of
the
school's
property.
If
anything
goes
wrong,
i
will
be
right
there
to
see
it.
I
will
repeat
what
i
said
before.
My
kid
will
NOT
see
this
boy
again.
They
are
going
to
different
high
schools.
The
secret
santa
takes
place
on
the
last
day
of
school
when
they
leave
at
9am
anyway.

My daughter (11) is softly spoken and can take a
while to get her thoughts out, which means that people-
including family- have a tendency to speak over her. Her
brother (14) started talking over her at dinner tonight and
I butted in and told her if she’s not finished
to loudly say ‘I’m talking!’ My husband said ‘well you
should say- ‘Sorry, I’m still talking’ in a calm tone,
but I disagreed and said she doesn’t have to be
polite to people who are being rude to her. Who
is right?EDIT for those asking why I didn’t correct my
son, I have on multiple occasions.

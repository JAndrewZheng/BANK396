AITA for refusing to let my husband have a baby
with his best friend? We already have one 10yo son,
and i cant have any more children. His friend doesn’t
have a partner but wants kids. He sees her three
times a week after he puts our son to bed
and they have been talking about it for months. I
already said no 2 months ago but he now says
the feeling won’t go away. I was very compassionate and
understanding of both their needs but now i feel betrayed,
angry and extremely vulnerable and insecure. He has always said
he wants to be the same loving father and husband
in our family but he has enough love also to
be a father to another child. I dont think he
can do this without hurting the family he already has
and he should be putting all of his love and
energy into us. Now he says i cant tell him
what to do and he wont leave. Am I the
mad one?!

My gf of 3 months and I went on a
2-week-long vacation together. The flight back was delayed. We were
supposed to land at 21:00 and we landed at like
22:40-22:45 or so.To get home, I take a train from
the airport, it takes under 10 mins, I’m very close.
The last trains were at 23:00 and 23:30. My gf
needs to take a train and a bus, it normally
takes her about half an hour, but she told me
she would just get a taxi since she feels unsafe
in the area where she has to change and she
doesn’t wanna run after trains and buses. We weren’t planning
to go both to mine or her place because the
next day we needed to be at the office and
each of us lives right next to their workplace.Once we
landed, I said that once they open the doors I
will run to the train station so I could make
it to the train at 23:00. My gf seemed bothered,
she didn’t say anything and said everything was fine, but
I could tell. It took a long time until they
let us out, I didn’t run and waited with her
until she got herself a taxi, then waited for my
last train for about 10 mins and went home.AITA if
I would have run? Or simply for wanting to do
that?

I
shared
custody
of
my
2
children
equally.
I
haven’t
seen
my
youngest
son
for
4
weeks.
A
little
backstory:
my
eldest
child
is
homeschooled
bc
with
an
ADHD
diagnosis
and
other
stresses
of
school,
it
was
in
his
best
interests.
He
is
now
a
happy
child
vastly
different
to
what
he
was
whilst
in
the
school
system.
My
ex
and
I
share
homeschooling.
Understandably,
my
youngest
also
wants
to
be
homeschooled.
I
have
not
agreed
to
this
as
he
is
a
very
bright
boy
and
thrives
in
school.
I
feel
the
benefits
of
him
being
in
school
far
outweigh
the
perceived
negatives.
My
ex
wants
him
to
be
homeschooled
and
has
gone
as
far
as
trying
to
implement
this
without
me.
Because
of
this,
my
son
has
refused
to
see
me
for
the
last
month.
I
have
explained
to
him
my
reasons
for
why
I
don’t
think
he
should
be
homeschooled
but
there
is
only
so
much
a
11
year
old
could
understand
of
the
ramifications.
My
ex
has
now
said
he
doesn’t
want
to
come
to
mine
at
Christmas.
We
alternate
these
and
it
is
my
turn
for
Christmas
Eve
etc.
My
relationship
with
both
my
children
is
very
close
and
it’s
extremely
upsetting
going
through
this.
My
ex
asked
if
I
would
be
sending
the
gifts
I
have
bought
him
to
hers
and
when
I
said
I
wouldn’t,
said
I
was
unfair.My
reasoning
is
that
as
much
as
he
might
dislike
my
decision
re
homeschooling
from
which
this
all
stems
from,
I
would
not
teach
him
it
is
ok
to
treat
me
this
way.
I
am
a
very
involved,
present
parent,
and
it
seems
he
doesn’t
want
to
see
me
to
cause
me
pain.
As
much
as
this
hurts,
I
don’t
feel
I
should
give
in,
however
long
this
takes.
AITA?

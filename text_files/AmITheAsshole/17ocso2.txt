My aunt and her family are staying with us for
a while. My aunt and her husband are both very
religious people and heavily control what their daughter "Sara" (12F)
wears. I go really well with Sara since she was
little. Sara expressed to me she feels very weird around
her peers because of the way she dresses. Her mom
buys all her clothes so she basically doesn't have any
options. So this time Sara came to visit us and
she has hit a growth spurt and now we're basically
the same size(I'm very petite, she's pretty tall for her
age). So yesterday we were all going out for a
picnic. I let Sara wear one of my dresses. A
really cute pastel colored dress I made a year ago.
I got her matching accessories too and she was very
happy. We both dressed up and went downstairs to join
the family. But he'll broke loose. My aunt started screaming
at both Sara and me for our "obscene" clothing choice.
She told me I had no right to dress her
daughter the way I wanted and that I was trying
to drag her away from religion too by indoctrinating her.
That she decides how her daughter is raised and not
me. Sara started to cry and went upstairs, refused to
go anymore. My aunt kept knocking on the door and
forced her to open it. Then she took her redressed
her then forced her to the picnic. The girl was
sobbing the whole time. I previously planned on giving Sara
some of my clothes but now I don't know. I
mean aunt is right that I'm just her cousin. But
I don't think I'm "indoctrinating" her daughter by letting her
wear what she wants. AITA?**Edit: Sara actually recently started wearing
a hijab. I didn't mention initially because I thought it'd
bring up unnecessary debate on that topic . So yeah,
I also let her not wear a hijab. She really
doesn't care about hijab but her parents do.

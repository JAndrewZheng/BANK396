I (40F) live in the second-to-last of a row of
townhouses. I'm also a freelance business owner (sole proprietor) and
"work at home" mom to 2 kids (7F and 3mo
M).My neighbor(s) in the end unit has spent *most of
this year* doing construction inside their house, including pounding from
hammers and noise from power tools, off and on. Seriously,
I remember back in *at least* March not being able
to sleep because they were using power tools in the
area behind the wall right behind mine and my husband's
bed after 9:00 p.m. (nose ordinances start at 10 or
11).Just in the last 30 minutes (13:15ish to 13:45), I've
been trying to get my son down for a nap,
but whether we're upstairs or down, the neighbor is pounding
and using power tools again.I feel like the length of
time they've been doing such construction--even with the short breaks
they've been taking every now and then (I don't remember
how long the breaks have been, but not long enough--in
weeks--to be memorable)--is excessive, and whatever they're doing should have
been done *months ago*.I've had an issue with this neighbor
blasting *live* music from their house because they were practicing
with their band at home while I worked before (and
it gave me a headache), so I'm not sure if
I should ask how long the construction will go on
or not.So, reddit, WIBTA if I asked when the neighbor(s)
will be done with the loud construction inside their home?

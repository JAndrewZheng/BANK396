I (22M) was at my friend’s (24M) apartment the other
day. I had to use the bathroom (those damn nachos!)
and as I went to sit, I heard a crack
and realized his toilet had broken. I let him know
what happened; the next day he called me with some
estimates for a new toilet. I said I don’t agree
to pay because a) I don’t know if the toilet
was already broken when I sat on it; b) most
likely his toilet just wore out, because I didn’t do
anything purposefully to break it, wasn’t reckless and I weight
170 pounds. He took this is if I was implying
something about his weight - my friend weights over 350
pounds. I was not referring to his weight (aren’t toilets
supposed to be resistant anyway?), but I took his lead
to say that yes, it would be more likely he’s
at fault here. He texted me later to say I
was being an AH to him. Am I?

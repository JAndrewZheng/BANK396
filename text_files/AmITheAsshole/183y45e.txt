I
(f30)
have
a
complicated
relationship
with
my
parents.
They
had
me
and
my
siblings
very
young
and
never
really
had
a
chance
to
find
themselves
as
people
before
they
were
parents.
As
a
result,
they
made
a
lot
of
questionable
parenting
decisions
and
home
life
wasn’t
the
most
stable.
My
siblings
and
I
all
left
home
as
soon
as
we
were
able.Well,
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
my
mom
decided
to
leave
my
dad.
Their
relationship
got
worse
and
worse
with
an
empty
nest
and
it
was
incredibly
toxic.
My
dad
had
a
few
untreated
mental
health
issues
and
was
mentally/emotionally
abusive
and
my
mom
hit
a
point
where
she
was
enabling
other
issues
and
she
knew
it.
Leaving
was
the
best
thing
for
her,
and
she
had
a
friend
who
was
willing
to
help
her
get
out.
She
left
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
it
just
so
happened
that
when
my
dad
woke
up
to
his
wife
gone,
he
also
found
out
a
medical
emergency
meant
he’d
be
losing
his
last
living
parent.
It
was
awful
timing,
but
I
get
why
my
mom
couldn’t
just
come
back
and
keep
putting
herself
last.
After
several
months,
mom
started
dating
the
man
who
was
“just
a
friend”
who
helped
her
leave
and
dad
found
someone
new
as
well.
It
was
incredibly
awkward
for
me,
but
they
all
seemed
happy
and
I
wanted
to
be
happy
for
them.
However,
both
of
my
parents
are
much
more
involved
in
their
new
families
than
they
ever
were
with
us
kids,
and
they
hardly
see
their
grandchildren.
Still,
I’ve
tried
to
make
peace
with
this.
Where
I’m
really
having
a
hard
time
now,
though,
is
that
my
dad’s
girlfriend
has
pushed
him
to
get
into
therapy
and
start
working
through
his
issues.
He’s
improving,
but
the
past
trauma
is
still
there.
On
the
other
side,
my
mom’s
boyfriend
has
helped
her
be
much
more
independent,
but
he’s
pretty
bigoted
and
she
acts
like
he’s
royalty.
It’s
easier
to
connect
with
dad’s
girlfriend,
even
as
I
feel
awkward
about
it.
But
I
just
don’t
want
to
get
to
know
mom’s
boyfriend
better
because
the
more
I
learn
the
less
I
like
him.
AITA?TL;DR
-
Complicated
familial
dynamics
have
made
it
easier
for
me
to
connect
with
my
dad’s
girlfriend
than
my
mom’s
boyfriend,
even
though
my
mom’s
boyfriend
helped
her
leave
her
toxic
marriage.
AITA
for
not
wanting
to
get
closer
to
him?

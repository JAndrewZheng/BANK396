A little background first. This guy is a lifelong friend
I've known for 40 years. And until about 10 years
ago we were very tight; the kind of mates where
you only need to look to know what the other
person is thinking. Anyway, he became a dad in 2013,
and again in 2015, and he pretty much dropped right
out of my life immediately it happened. I can see
how his life would get busy, but any time I
wanted to go out or hang out (including my birthday)
he was always too busy or his wife was working.
I'd always drop by on their birthdays with a gift
on the day, but my birthday would come and go
with maybe a text message, and occasionally I'd get a
gift months later when they could be arsed. Of course,
I moved on with my life, and got new friends
and have been in a happy relationship with my girlfriend
for 7 years. We've never been invited to their home,
despite inviting them (they are vegans, so that is an
extra level of complexity for social dinners etc), and over
the decade after his first daughter was born I think
we caught up maybe four or five times a year
(from maybe four or five times a fortnight before). Now
his kids are old enough that they sleep through the
night and he doesn't feel bad about leaving his wife
babysitting them, he wants to start going out for beers
and trying to get back to being old mates again.
But I'm pretty pissed off that I got dropped like
a hot brick once he had kids, and TBH I've
kind of moved on. AITA?

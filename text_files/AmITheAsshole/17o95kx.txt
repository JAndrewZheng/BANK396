I know how stupid it sounds.  AND I’d like
to preface by saying I do not normally slurp my
food, and I can understand how gross/unattractive it can be.
I was eating on piece of watermelon, which my boyfriend
had cut into really thick slices- so thick it was
hard to cut into them with a fork which was
all I had. We were watching TV, happily munching away
when he turns to me and gives me a dirty
face. I ask what was up, and he pauses the
show to say, “Why are you eating your food like
a vacuum? Eat like a human!”I apologized and said it
was just really juicy and that the slices were so
big. Then he got demeaning and said, “let me show
you something” and began to use his fork to cut
small sections off. Like…Anyway I found it rude and got
mad. Then he got mad because I’m his mind he
was asking me to stop nicely. But WHAT ABOUT THAT
WAS NICE??

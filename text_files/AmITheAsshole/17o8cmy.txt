I (47f) have been living alone in my place, I
have looked after my parents when they were sick &
in hospital & now that I'm on my own, kids
have moved out want to be able to live life,
travel. All things I couldn't do previously.I have older siblings
who never had the responsibilities placed on them because they
are male, got to go do what they wanted, education,
travel etc.Our father recently passed & I haven't been able
to properly grieve him.  My mother & one of
my older siblings keep saying it would be great for
me to move in & be there. We don't have
the closest relationship, it's been quite strained for a long
time, although I have been there when needed. I feel
that one of my older siblings could step up as
they have never had to before.  They don't want
to give up their life, but expect me to.AITA for
not wanting to?

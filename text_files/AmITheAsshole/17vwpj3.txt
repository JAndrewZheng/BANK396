Sorry in advance for being really vague but if I
gave more details it'd be obvious who the parties are.
I run a meeting series between two departments with the
aim of helping out some of the team with a
complex task. It's been really successful on a lot of
fronts, especially finding confusion in an objective way. My role
between these two teams is to ensure data quality. I
have been tracking a really serious issue for over a
year. There has been minor progress in getting it resolved.
I believe, for context, it's a really easy fix but
it may involve accepting something unintuitive by consequence. This serious
issue has been naturally popping up in the meeting series
I run. This sparked a conversation between myself and a
stakeholder during the meeting. I restated my position and the
issues I see in his approach. Another member of the
team agreed with me and refined my idea in a
really helpful way. The stakeholder gets very agitated so I
suggest we just drop it but he keeps going. I
state I think we should take this conversation offline so
we can focus on the meeting. He keeps going. I
reaffirm my position.He then states I need to drop this
issue entirely. I then ask that if I drop this
issue the following has to be acknowledged: 1) This issue
will get worse2) He takes full ownership of this issueHe
gave the acknowledgement and stated he doesn't care. I reported
this conversation to someone I work with, who is directly
impacted by this issue. They suggested we escalate the issue
because this is very serious. I consulted with another member,
who isn't directly impacted, on my team and they suggested
the same thing. So I took their advice. I'm in
the process of escalation right now but I worry I'm
making a mountain over a molehill. It's absurd to me
to spend so much of my time on dealing with
this. Plus I feel like an ahole who may be
punishing someone for what could be just a bad day.
So AITA?

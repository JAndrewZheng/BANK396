I just got engaged to my partner of 4 years,
and my parents said they would throw us an engagement
party. They are paying for everything, but want to make
it a shared engagement party for both me and my
sister. I have a slight problem with this because my
sister isn't actually engaged.She has been dating her boyfriend for
12 years, and he gave her a promise ring shortly
after my engagement. We're all in our late 20's/early 30's,
so pretty much everyone except for my sister and our
parents thinks that it is kind of childish and ridiculous.
I have had many conversations with my sister over the
years that have boiled down to "Look, if he wanted
to marry you, he would," but she has stayed with
him and held out hope. And I suppose she took
the promise ring as a "close enough" kind of gesture
because she is treating it exactly like an engagement ring.
My fiance reached out to her boyfriend because he was
equally confused and said "Uh are you guys engaged?" and
he outright said that they weren't. Nonetheless, my sister is
showing the ring to everyone and even putting together a
wedding planning binder.I feel bad for her, I really do,
but she's also a grown woman and I don't feel
like I should have to enable this farce. I've been
dealing with "Don't forget about [sister]! Make sure [sister] is
included!" my whole life and I was really hoping that
my engagement, if nothing else, would actually be my own.I'd
rather just not have an engagement party at all than
play along with this weird fantasy. My fiance would rather
have a weird party than no party, and my parents
are scolding me for being so selfish to want to
exclude my sister.

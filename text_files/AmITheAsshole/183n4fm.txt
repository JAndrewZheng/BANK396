I'm
(35M)
a
9th
grade
science
teacher
and

recently
over
the
last
few
months
one
of
my
students
"Caleb"
(14M)

has
shown
an
inappropriate
interest
in
me.
I
tried
to
just
ignore
it
at
first
cause
you
know
hes
a
good
kid
,
a
wrestler
and
makes
good
grades
etc.

I
thought
hed
just
get
over
it
but
its
gotten
worse.
He
brought
me
flowers
thr
other
day.The
thing
is
I'm
pretty
sure
hes
only
somewhat
out
at
school
and
definitely
not
at
home
from
what
I
can
tell
when
I
met
his
parents
who
seem
kinda
homophobic
by
the
way
they
reacted
to
the
pride
flag
i
keep
in
my
room.
I
know
I'm
supposed
to
have
a
talk
with
him
and
tell
my
supervisor
about
it
and
possibly
get
Caleb's
parents
involved
if
it
keeps
going
but
I
also
dont
want
to
possibly
out
this
kid.
But
the
way
things
are
going
I

might
have
to.
Wibta
if
i
said
anything?

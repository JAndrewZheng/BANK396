My girlfriend wants to get married in Florida where she
grew up, but the only people that can afford to
attend our wedding there from my family's side would be
my own parents and me. I told her that maybe
we can consider getting married in England where majority of
my family lives and a good majority (60%) of her
family can also attend. She also has family members there
who she is really close to. She says that as
a compromise we can have a pre-wedding party + wedding
reception in England and have the main wedding in Florida,
but I'm just finding it hard to comprehend attending a
wedding (in this case my own wedding) where all of
her family is there, but all of my close family
members and friends would not be able to attend... She
recently said that a health complication came up for her
parent that would prevent them from being out of the
country for more than a few weeks which is another
strong reason why we should have the wedding in Florida.
I told her that although a wedding is a lot
of work to plan, their parent would not have to
be out of the country for more than a few
days and can be back to continue their treatment in
time... We both have family in the country that can
help us plan it regardless. I told her she's being
unfair in not considering having a wedding in England, and
that this would be a very one sided wedding. Her
response has been that she's willing to compromise already by
having everything besides the wedding in England, and I'm being
"inconsiderate" of her parents health. AITA in my thinking and
not being very flexible in having the wedding in Florida,
and calling her inconsiderate for not agreeing to England?Tl:dr: Girlfriend
wants to get married in Florida where no one besides
my parents and myself can attend. I proposed England saying
that at least majority of both sides (majority of my
family and 60% of hers) can attend that location. AITA
for telling my girlfriend that I dont want to get
married at the wedding venue she wants?

Okay so this happened a few months ago, and my
friend and I are over it, but I still think
about it sometimes because I find it really weird lol.Okay
so basically, my (16F) friend's (17F) boyfriend (16M) told us
he didn't want his mashed potatoes. He asked my friend
if she wanted them, she said no. So I said
I'll take them. He gave me the mashed potatoes, and
I didn't think anything of it until a few seconds
later when I tried to talk to my friend like
normal, and she was acting funky. I asked her if
she's okay, and she said "No." I asked her if
I did something, she said "Yes, and I'll tell you
later." So the rest of the day I'm nervous about
what she's gonna say, because I couldn't think of anything
I did wrong! So a few hours later, she said
"It's really stupid, but I was upset at you for
taking my boyfriend's potatos" and I was like "Yeah, that
is stupid, haha", and she got upset at me for
calling it stupid, even though SHE HERSELF called it stupid????
Why can she call it stupid, but I can't? And
it's not like I said it in a mean way,
either! So, AITA for receiving some mashed potatoes?(Also, for some
context, her and her boyfriend were a new relationship at
the time, so maybe she was a bit overprotective of
her new bf? But it's not like I was after
her man, I'm a lesbian lol!)

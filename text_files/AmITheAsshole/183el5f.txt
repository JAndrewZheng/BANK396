My
daughter
(25)
has
had
problems
with
her
feet
since
she’s
been
able
to
walk.
She
has
flat
feet,
her
feet
turn
in
when
she
walks,
and
she
walks
on
the
sides
of
her
feet.
When
she
was
little
we
considered
feet
braces
for
her
but
we
wanted
to
see
if
she’d
grow
out
of
it
so
we
decided
to
wait.
Then
life
happened
and
we
weren’t
able
to
get
them
for
her
anymore
but
she
never
grew
out
of
these
habits.
Now
she’s
saying
it
hurts
to
stand
and
she
may
have
to
get
surgery
to
help
with
some
of
her
issues
but
that
wouldn’t
have
been
necessary
if
she
got
braces
when
she
was
a
kid.
She
asked
us
to
pay
for
the
surgery/treatment
but
we
said
no
because
she’s
an
adult
with
a
fiancé
and
a
job.
Now
she’s
mad
at
us
because
she
thinks
we
caused
theses
issues
so
we
have
to
pay
for
it.
AITA
for
not
getting
her
foot
braces
when
she
was
a
kid?

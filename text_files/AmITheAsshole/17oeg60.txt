So for context, my boyfriend (of 7 years) and I
live together and I’ve noticed he’s been talking to another
girl more and more. He plays games with her online.
I don’t have a problem with him gaming with girls,
but we did have a situation where a long time
gaming partner made a move on him even when she
knew about me. They’re still friends but that’s another story.
So when he was at work, I decided to go
read his messages. I felt guilty but I had a
bad feeling. I didn’t realize that they had been up
almost all night every day talking. I noticed a couple
times he said he was going somewhere with “friends” when
he was really going with me. I saw no mention
of me after their two months of talking. They are
a little too mushy and flirty for my liking. It’s
subtle but it’s enough. I ended up telling him all
about what I read and we were kind of okay.
He kept promising that she knew about me. So the
other day we were watching tv together and she kept
blowing up his phone and he refused to stop texting
her. I just don’t understand. So last night he was
working again and I did it again. This time I
decided I was going to add her on discord and
see if he said I was a friend or his
girlfriend. I was happy when he said I was his
girlfriend. But then her next response was “Can I ask
why you haven’t told me about her before?” I was
very upset. He played dumb in his response to her.
When he got home I confronted him again and said
he lied to me. He keeps saying he didn’t even
though the evidence is literally in front of us. So
now she hasn’t responded. I kept telling him she was
probably getting the wrong idea from him and he denied.
So now she’s not responding to him. That’s unlike her.
He’s now acting like it’s my fault. He’s the one
that didn’t tell her about me. Yes I was wrong
in adding her for those reasons and reading his messages.
I just feel like he can’t be mad at me
for her not responding. Is that my fault? Am I
the asshole?

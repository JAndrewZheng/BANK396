I(29W) am a Chinese-American with Chinese immigrant parents who worked
very hard and provided me with a great life and
who I respect a lot.So me and my fiancé (31M)
are getting married during next year’s spring and we are
currently planning our wedding, as my fiancé is white our
wedding would be just like a pretty typical traditional wedding
with the white dress and vows, except 1 part.In Chinese
culture, we usually have a session where the couple will
crouch on the floor, bow and offer tea to our
elders, and to honour my parents, I suggested we do
that at our wedding too.However my fiancé strongly denied it
and said that it was dehumanising and called me an
asshole for even suggesting that as it meant that I
thought he didn’t respect himself, which is untrue.While I just
wanted this to be a way for him to experience
my culture, is it true that I’m forcing him to
do something that’s dehumanising? I always thought this was just
a respectful thing to do and have never questioned it
as I grew up with my culture.Also more info: My
fiancé isn’t religious and he was born in America, with
both his parents also being American, I believe his ancestors
came from and Irish descent, however his family never participates
in any cultural event. Where as my family are Buddhist,
however I personally am not religious. In addition my fiancé
has never expressed any displeasure with my culture in the
past, as he is comfortable with attending cultural activities and
holidays, which makes this even more shocking.More info to clear
up misunderstandings:1st The ceremony isn’t like a kowtow, its more
like where you kneel or crouch in a way similar
to the way how Japanese people sit while the elders
is sitting on a couch like object and the couple
will pour tea into a small cup and offer it
to the elders with a slight bow, and this is
not just for my parents it is usually for both
sides of the couple’s parents.2nd I never forced/insisted after he
denied to do it, and we are both calming down
on our own.

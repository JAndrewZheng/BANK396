I
(17F)
has
a
stepdad
(54M)
whose
been
married
to
my
mom
(50F)
for
a
few
years
now.
One
thing
about
him
is
he
makes
me
uncomfortable.

as
he
can’t
respect
my
boundaries
or
privacy.
Like
if
im
showering
in
the
bathroom
(which
only
locks
from
the
outside)
he
tends
to
come
inside
to
pee
(despite
the
house
having
2
bathroom)
and
comment
on
my
body
and
how
he
can
see
it.
He
also
tends
to
comment
on
my
breast
and
butt
as
they
gotten
bigger,
saying
things
like
there
really
nice
and
look
good.
Theres
many
more
reasons
but
theses
2
are
the
main
ones.
Now
on
to
the
problem
if
im
the
ahole,
but
one
thing
I
like
to
note
is
hes
a
very
affectionate
person
and
likes
to
give
hugs
and
kisses,
which
I
don’t
feel
comfortable
receiving.
So
when
he
asks
I
try
to
come
up
with
excuses
or
straight
up
tell
him
i
don’t
feel
comfortable,
to
which
he
acts
all
sad
and
my
mom
yells
at
me
and
forces
me
because
it
hurts
his
feelings.
Which
is
very
frustrating,
so
when
we
had
a
thanks
giving
dinner,
with
all
our
family
being
there
and
he
tried
to
hug
me
(
despite

me
saying
no
and
i
don’t

feel
comfortable
)
he
tried
to
forced
it
anyways,
which
resulted
to
me
pushing
him
away
and
yelling
at
him.
Which
later
resulted
into
me
getting
yelled
at
by
his
sister
and
my

mom,
saying
I’m
acting
like
a
bitch
for
no
reason
as
he’s
just
trying
to
show
his
daughter
some
love,
and
I’m
an
ahole
for
hurting
his
feeling.
So
am
I
the
ahole
and
should
I
just
suck
it
up
to
avoid
problems?Ill
also
like
to
add
my
mom
knows
about
him
commenting
on
my
body
and
walking
in
on
me
showering,
but
she
excuses
his
behavior,
as
he’s
complementing
you
or
oh
he
couldn’t
hold
his
pee
long
enough
to
go
to
the
other
bathroom.
And
excuses
me
being
uncomfortable
as,
i
shouldn’t
be
when
he’s
my
dad
or
to
just
suck
it
up
so
you
don’t
hurt
his
feelings.Another
note
he’ll
also
try
to
sit
me
on
his
lap,
or
tries
to
get
me
to
cuddle
with
him
despite
me
telling
him
every-time
i
don’t
feel
comfortable
doing
so.
And
he
still
asks
and
acts
like
it
hurts
his
feelings
when
I
don’t.

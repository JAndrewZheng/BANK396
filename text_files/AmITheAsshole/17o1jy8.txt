A close friend of mine is getting married in April.
She’s selected four of us to be in her wedding
party in addition to her sister. We’re all in our
late 20s/early 30s.I’ve known her for several years and already
knew that her wedding, whenever that day happened, would be
elaborate. She wants to do group activities with all the
ladies, including a mini trip away into the mountains for
spa things, wine tasting, and hiking. Although I did mention
that a mountain hike in the weeks/months leading up to
D-Day is ill-advised, I was totally stoked and grateful. Until
she told us that she hired a trainer and nutrition
coach for the bridal party. Meaning weekly workouts and tailored
eating plans, etc. she says she just wants us all
to look our best for the pictures and fit into
the dresses. She’s worried about “bad aesthetics”.I think this is
a bit over the top and kind of inappropriate. Only
one other bridesmaid has spoken up besides me, but she
super quickly changed her tune after Bride said that she’d
already spent so much money on everything.I’m recovering from anorexia/orthorexia,
and no one in the party knows about it because
it’s none of their business. I’m not comfortable with this
at all, and honestly all these women, including the bride,
are so vain and body conscious that I can’t bear
the next six months listening to them.I told her this
and she wasn’t happy at all, played the “I’ve never
had a special day” card and reminded me that she’s
paying for literally everything and I’m being an ungrateful AH.My
boyfriend soft agrees bc 1. he’s a groomsman and it
would be awkward, and 2. He thinks if I tell
her about my ED, she’ll understand. I shouldn’t have to
disclose that info.WIBTA for dropping out of the whole ordeal
and/or skipping the whole event?

Hi, I’m sorry for the way this is probably going
to be redacted, english is not my first language and
also I’m already in a legal age in my country,
with that being said I'll start.I (18F) have a friend
called Lilian (18F) she’s been such an amazing person with
me, always being supportive and helpful to me, i’ve known
her since my first year of high school, we are
on our last year.A couple months ago, I met my
boyfriend, our relationship is pretty healthy, we share a lot
of common interests and stuff, but the thing that at
least we don’t have much in common is about intimacy.You
see, I’m not really interested in having intimate relationships with
people (sexual way) and also with physical contact, I don’t
know if i’m quite scared or I just don’t feel
prepared for it, I’ve never kissed someone before and it’s
been a hurtful thought in my head and one of
my biggest insecurities in my relationship, since I cannot satisfy
my boyfriend that way, but he’s been always supportive about
this and he always told me he’s fine with it.Last
days, my bf, Lilian, me and a couple other friends
we have in common went out to a park near
our school, we were just talking about our day and
school stuff with some music on the background when Lilian
started making sexual jokes about my relationship with my bf,
she started with “You two have been together for a
while, i’m pretty sure your intimate relationship is amazing” or
making fun about that kind of stuff.Lilian often says her
relationship is pretty sexual active and she tries to give
us advice in that kind of stuff, I already told
her my posture in those situations and she told me
it’s alright and i’ll be prepared one day, but it
seems she’s trying to push me off to do it
the quickest possible and that’s uncomfortable for me.My bf told
her she’s making me uncomfortable and it’s not the place
to speak about that, but she brushed it off and
kept going. I told her again I already spoke with
her about this but she says i’m being too sensitive
about it and now she’s mad at me for it.I
don’t know if I should apologize but I feel I
wasn’t being rude or disrespectful to her for reminding her
my boundaries, AITA?

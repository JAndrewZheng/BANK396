I have 4 kids. When my 3 older kids got
married I paid for their weddings however my youngest is
getting married now and I told him I won't be
paying for it. I have my own reasons for that.My
most important reason is that my youngest has a daughter
with his ex girlfriend. She is a good kid generally
but sometimes getting along with her is not easy. My
youngest's fiancee doesn't get along with her and I don't
like the way she treats my granddaughter so I don't
approve of their marriage and I don't want to help
them get married. Am I wrong?

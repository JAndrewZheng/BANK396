I adopted my husband's niece Sarah 9 years ago. While
it was hard for Sarah to adapt at first, she
loves us and is our daughter. She's an amazing kid
and loves me and my family.I'm currently pregnant and two
weeks ago we found out it was a girl. When
we told my parents they were excited about their "first
granddaughter". It bother me but I tried to ignore it.
But yesterday I had enough. Mum was mentioning things to
pa down and I reacted stronger than I probably should
have, but I was pretty mad. Sarah is their grandaughter
since she was 2. Luckily they didn't say it around
Sarah but I was not happy. We had a fight
over it, with them claiming Sarah doesn't count and trying
to justify it by saying she's from my husband's family
not ours. But she's my daughter, their grandaughter. She calls
them her grandparents. My sister is her aunt and my
nephew is her cousin. If they don't accept Sarah then
there's no way I'm wanting them around either daughter.My husband
thinks what they said was wrong but thinks I should
let it go. He thinks it wasn't meant the way
I'm taking it. But with his history he tends to
be a bit of a push over when it comes
to family (understanding obviously, but still) and they haven't apologied,
if anything they've double down. I don't want Sarah hearing
any of this, and if I can't trust them to
treat our girls equal then I can't trust them with
them. Everyone else thinks I'm overreacting, but I don't agree.

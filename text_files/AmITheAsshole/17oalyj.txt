So I recently went on an overseas holiday with a
group of my friends. Two of these friends were to
be engaged overseas, one was my best girlfriend, the others
to guy friends. We had booked three different places to
stay and in each of the places, I was to
share a room with my best girlfriend. Two weeks before
the trip she has decided that her new boyfriend will
be coming along for the portion of the trip. Keep
in mind I have paid half of all the places
we were to stay as we are rooming together. When
we get there, my best girlfriend says that she wants
her boyfriend to stay in her room and we’re gonna
have to figure out where I stay. I’m a person
that really likes my personal space and really needs a
space to get away from everyone when I feel overwhelmed,
and this made me very stressed, and I made it
very clear that this is how I felt. It gets
to the day that her partner is coming and everyone
has made me feel like the villain, because I don’t
want to move out of my room even, and there
isn’t really anywhere for me to stay comfortable with my
belongings. Well, I get kicked out of the room that
I had paid for, and she paid for a pull-out
bed for me to bunk in with a newly engaged
couple. I love these 2 and have zero against them,
and they didn’t mind having me at all. (Not the
point) They are beautiful people but I did want my
space to be able to escape and do what I
need to do and sleep well. Even though I was
uncomfortable and had to move all of my things on
holidays, I bit my tongue and did this and slept
in the their room. The whole time I was so
uncomfortable intruding on the newly engaged couple, and had the
worst night sleep and sorest back from the hardest bed.
I couldn’t escape from everyone when I needed a break,
and had no real privacy. Am I an arsehole for
being shitty with this?

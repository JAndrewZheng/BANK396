Every
Saturday
me
(29F)
and
my
husband
(44M)
make
a
video
call
with
my
in
laws
in
Japan
so
they
can
see
our
4
month
baby
.I
have
postpartum
depression
and
anxiety
,just
today
started
medication.
So
daily
chores
and
dressing
up
feels
like
too
much
work.Usually
when
we
call
I
didn't
even
took
a
shower
cuz
felt
really
lazy
to
do
so.So
today
woke
up
early
in
a
different
mood
,
ready
to
have
a
happy
day
so
took
a
shower
,
dressed
up
cute
and
started
to
cook
since
9am
so
the
stew
would
be
ready
to
eat
before
the
videocall.While
the
meat
was
still
boiling
(around
12pm)
husband
said
they're
not
online
yet
,
so
I
decided
to
frie
some
fries
and
eat
earlier
.*Note
that
his
parents
are
in
their
80s,
don't
know
how
to
properly
use
Skype
and
need
help
from
my
husbands
brother*Just
when
I
put
the
fries
on
the
oil,
he
comes
to
the
kitchen
and
tells
me
they're
now
online
and
he
will
start
the
meeting
by
himself.I
got
upset
cuz
the
food
would
get
cold
so
I
asked
him
to
tell
them
to
wait
20
minutes
and
as
soon
as
we
finish
lunch
we
can
talk.So
he
goes
to
the
living
,
comes
back
and
tells
me
that
we
will
make
the
videocall
tomorrow.I'm
furious
.
Tried
to
explain
to
him
that
I
hate
when
he
cancels
meetings
last
minute
without
even
asking
my
opinion
.He
says
that
no
need
to
be
so
upset,
doesn't
want
to
quarrel
,
apologized
yet
said
if
it
was
him
he
would
have
warmed
up
the
fries
later
(which
in
my
opinion
is
a
horrible
idea
cuz
the
taste
is
bad).So
yeah
,
third
time
I
got
upset
again
cuz
obviously
he
is
not
taking
in
account
my
effort
of
be
ready
and
presentable
for
his
family
but
also
cooking
and
breastfeeding
our
baby
.I
know
it's
his
family
,
but
told
him
a
lot
of
times
how
important
these
meetings
are
for
me
since
I
have
no
family
to
talk
about
the
milestones
of
our
baby
and
is
the
only
time
of
the
week
I
feel
happy
for
someone
feeling
happy
for
my
baby.So
finally
he
is
all
upset
cuz
we
had
a
quarrel
and
I
honestly
don't
know
if
it's
my
fault
but
cannot
help
to
feel
upset
and
feel
like
crying.AITA?EDIT

comments.

to

YTA

who
NTA

your
time

Apologies
in
advance
for
a
long
read.I
(27F)
have
a
younger
sister
Bailey
(24F).
We
were
6
and
3
when
our
parents
got
divorced.
They
had
split
legal
custody
over
both
of
us,
however,
we
lived
with
our
mum.
Shortly
after
the
divorce,
we
moved
from
NV
to
MN
due
to
the
mum’s
work.
I
always
kept
close
contact
with
my
father
while
Bailey
was
more
attached
to
our
mum.All
throughout
the
school,
I
was
certain
I’ll
go
to
college
after.
Bailey,
on
the
other
hand,
never
wanted
to
keep
studying
and
after
she
graduated
from
high
school,
she
moved
in
back
with
our
dad
to
his
property
in
NV.The
property
in
question
is
fairly
large
and
nice,
if
not
for
the
fact
that
it’s
a
former
ranch
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
in
a
desert.
You
literally
need
to
drive
for
about
20
miles
to
get
to
the
nearest
town.Important
mention:
for
my
sweet
16,
my
father
gave
me
his
old
used
car.
It’s
a
mid
90s
Chevy
truck,
but
since
dad
maintained
it
in
good
condition
and
I
kept
up
with
the
maintenance,
it
runs
just
like
new.
I
still
drive
it
and
don’t
plan
to
get
rid
of
it.
Bailey
also
got
a
car
for
her
sweet
16,
it
was
a
newer
car,
but
she
didn’t
care
about
it
much
and
so
the
car
was
in
a
poor
technical
condition.Fast
forward
to
now,
I
graduated,
I
work
for
a
big
company,
I
live
in
NYC.
Bailey
lives
with
our
dad
on
the
property,
works
at
a
casino
in
the
nearest
town.
Recently,
her
car
broke
down
completely
and
had
to
be
scrapped.
She
asked
dad
about
taking
his
car
and
dad
said
no
as
said
car
has
a
huge
sentimental
value
to
him.
Realising
that
she
can’t
afford
a
new
car,
she
started
bugging
me
to
sell
her
my
car
for
slightly
more
than
it’s
market
value.The
thing
is,
I
don’t
want
to
sell
my
car.
Yes
it’s
impractical
to
drive
in
NYC.
Yes
it
consumes
a
lot
of
gas.
But
it’s
my
first
car,
a
present
from
my
father.
I
told
her
I
can
pay
the
initial
fee
for
her
new
car.
She
said
she
wants
a
Suburban
like
mine,
but
a
newer
one.
I
told
her
no
because
it’s
a
very
pricey
car
and
she
won’t
handle
the
maintenance.
Please
note
that
our
dad
is
retired
and
therefore
can’t
contribute.
They
live
off
his
retirement
savings
and
Bailey’s
income.
Our
mum
also
refused
to
contribute.
She
said
she
would
give
Bailey
her
old
car,
an
old
Camry,
but
only
if
Bailey
flies
to
MN
and
picks
it
up
or
pays
for
the
haulage.
Bailey
obviously
refused
this
offer.
However,
they
both
are
judgemental
towards
me
because
I
refused
to
sell
my
car
to
my
sister,
drive
from
NYC
to
NV
and
then
fly
back
and
buy
another
car.

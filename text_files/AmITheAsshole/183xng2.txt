I
got
a
text
from
my
downstairs
neighbor
today.
They
live
in
my
house,

in
an
apartment
downstairs.

They
are
a
family
member
to
my
spouse.
In
the
first
place,
I
told
them
I
didn't
want
anyone
living
in
our
apartment.

They
begged
saying
they
would
be
homeless
or
have
to
"live
in
the
ghetto."
(Their
words,
not
mine!)
As
they
were
getting
their
house
worked
on
and
can't
live
in
it
while
it's
being
done.
My
spouse
caved
and
said
ok.
We
have
3
under
age
kids.
Also
my
daughter
21
and
her
bf
22
all
living
upstairs
with
us.
The
youngest
is
7.
I
told
them
from
the
start
that
it's
LOUD
in
the
apartment.
There
is
no
insulation
between
floors.
That
the
kids
run
and
play,
we
have
pets
that
also
run
and
play
.
They
said
it
was
fine
and
they
had
kids
before
and
it
wouldn't
bother
them
a
bit.
They've
made
underhanded
comments
about
the
kids
and
noise
before.
But
today
the
text
said
that
they
have
been
woken
up
5
times
today
by
the
kids.
That
it
isn't
just
walking,
it's
running,
bouncing,

playing
above
their
heads.
Now
to
clarify
some
things.
It's
4pm
on
a
Saturday
.
They
do
not
work
on
weekends.

Only
1
of
them
works
during
the
day
through
the
week.
The
1
person
has
some
health
issues
they
have
been
fighting
for
a
bit,
but
honestly,

they
are
one
of
those
people
who
ALWAYS
have
something
healthwise
going
on.
They
never
have
a
healthy
moment
and
most
times,
it's
a
pretty
sketchy
story
about
their
health.
In
privacy
of
the
home
they
are
perfectly
fine,
but
exiting
the
house,
it's
a
show
of
limping,
acting
in
pain,
etc
.

I
have
not
sent
a
text
back
,
it's
been
hours.
My
first
reaction
is
to
say
very
ugly
things
to
them.
I
didn't.
I've
just
been
simmering
on
it.
My
MIL
told
me
to
tell
them
that
maybe
it's
time
to
find
another
place
to
live,
since
their
health
situation
has
changed,
and
us
upstairs
being
a
family
of
7,
has
not.
I
also
want
to
tell
them
that
it's
absolutely
ridiculous
to
expect
children
in
their
own
home
to
be
quiet
at
4
pm
on
a
Saturday
afternoon!!
Would
I
be
the
A$$h0lâ‚¬
if
I
told
them
that
it's
time
to
move
along?

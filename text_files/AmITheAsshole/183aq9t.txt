We
live
in
the
same
street
as
my
inlaws.My
MIL
needs
help
with
different
things
every
day,
usually
something
simple
but
sometimes
something
that
takes
hours.My
husband
usually
deals
with
this,
as
I
am
disabled
and
am
the
main
caretaker
for
our
disabled
5yo.
(He
works,
I'm
SAH)My
MIL
recently
asked
me
to
come
over
and
help
her
with
some
things.
Simple
expectation
as
to
why
I
said
no.
Husband
wasn't
there
to
help,
couldn't
take
my
son
over
because
the
task
wasn't
safe
for
him
and
he
won't
let
me
leave
him
in
another
room,
I
will
not
leave
him
unattended
at
home,
even
for
a
few
minutes.
That's
exactly
what
she
wanted.
She
wanted
me
to
put
the
TV
on
his
show,
and
then
leave
him
there
"for
like
5
minutes".
She
couldn't
understand
why
I
said
not.
It's
*not
safe*.
She
thinks
I'm
the
AH
and
just
being
lazy
and
paranoid.
Not
only
could
he
hurt
himself,
or
but
what
if
someone
sees
me
leave?Call
me
paranoid,
but
I
just
don't
trust
people.
I
can't
trust
that
he
will
be
able
to
keep
himself
safe
due
to
his
age
and
disabilities,
and
I
cannot
trust
that
a
predator
could
see
it
as
an
opportunity.MIL
says
I'm
a
bad
DIL
and
should
help,
it's
not
a
big
deal.(Husband
is
as
involved
as
he
can
be
from
work,
and
is
fully
in
my
side.
But
since
he
can't
call
to
shut
MIL
down,
she
sees
it
as
him
agreeing
with
her
or
at
least
not
caring)So,
AITA
for
refusing
to
help
my
MIL,
because
I'm
too
lazy
and
"paranoid"
to
leave
my
son
home
alone
for
a
bit?

So for context my (20f) family’s dogs got out this
morning around 6:30 am. Our 3 dogs are all around
1-4 years old and are penned up 24/7 in a
large area in our backyard. We found them on a
property right next to ours. That property has 4 dogs
that are allowed to run free. They came out to
us and started aggressively barking and we shooed them away
while we collected our dogs. The neighbor called his dogs
back and while 1 listened the other 3 chased us
and we live next to a major Highway in a
very rural area so it can be busy. The neighbor
then drove over to our property and got onto us
saying that if his dogs got hit he would press
charges on us. We have video proof of his dogs
running free all over our property and near the Highway
so we told him to keep his dogs off our
property as they were riling up our dogs and that’s
probably why they escaped trying to get to them. And
we have reason to believe his dogs attacked my cat
through her pen since she is outside in a pen
as well because our dogs are friendly with her and
there was a huge bite on her back paw. My
mom said we should go over and apologize for causing
an argument but I told her no because his dogs
are the issue and there a lot of people that
drive on the property between us and the neighbor because
there was a small shop that is no longer open
but people still think it is  and the neighbors
dogs usually come over and see the cars and are
constantly crossing to come over to our property. We also
never had been near that guys property except for today
to get our dogs. The neighbor even called my mom
a bitch and told her to go change her tampon
because she was crying being worried about our own dogs.
Should we apologize to the neighbor or would we be
an asshole not to?

I
can't
stand
whipped
cream.
I
just
can't
handle
the
texture
and
the
taste
of
it
combined.
Its
not
even
one
of
those
“I
don't
like
it
but
ill
eat
it”
things,
the
taste
of
it
can
make
me
nauseous.When
I
get
coffee
I
always
ask
for
no
whipped
cream,
and
90%
of
the
time
I
get
it
anyway.
For
the
longest
time
i
would
say
nothing
and
just
throw
the
drink
away
when
I
got
to
the
whipped
cream
part,
but
I
stopped
doing
that
when
they
began
serving
drinks
with
whipped
cream
on
the
bottom.Now
when
I
see
them
adding
whipped
cream
I
will
mention
I
asked
for
no
whipped
cream.
I
always
try
to
be
polite,
but
I've
noticed
they
will
frequently
get
irritated
with
me
while
they
fix
the
drink.The
other
day
they
added
whipped
cream
to
my
drink.
I
was
about
to
say
something
when
the
person
who
was
with
me
told
me
to
just
take
the
drink.Today
someone
needed
to
redo
my
entire
drink,
and
they
got
mad
and
angerly
dumped
the
entire
thing
out.
They
apparently
weren't
told
about
my
request
so
they
were
mad
at
the
other
barista,
not
me,
but
still.I
spoke
to
my
barista
friend
and
he
got
a
bit
irritated
with
me
and
told
them
they
get
into
a
sort
of
“zone”
and
add
the
whipped
cream
automatically
and
its
hard
for
them
to
remember
not
to
add
it.
I
understand
that,
when
I
worked
as
a
cashier
I
would
do
similar
things
(asking
for
a
membership
card
when
I
already
received
it).
But
I
feel
like
the
drinks
are
so
expensive
already
and
I
want
to
enjoy
every
part
of
it.
I
don't
want
to
throw
the
toppings
away
because
they
are
on
top
of
a
bunch
of
whipped
cream.But
since
a
few
people
have
given
me
pushback,
I'm
starting
to
wonder
if
I'm
being
difficult
for
asking
them
do
redo
it
when
my
drink
is
wrong.AITA?

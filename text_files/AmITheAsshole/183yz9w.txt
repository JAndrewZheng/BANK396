I
work
in
a
call
center.
One
of
my
coworkers,
we'll
call
her
Calley,
has
recently
gotten
really
into
rabbits
to
the
point
she'll
call
in
or
email
everyone
saying
she
needs
the
day
off
because
she
has
to
go
on
a
'bunny
run'
to
get
a
new
rabbit
or
one
of
them
is
sick.
At
one
point,
she
had
between
five
and
ten
rabbits
in
her
apartment.Calley's
nice
enough
and
I
honestly
don't
mind
talking
to
her,
though
I
pointed
out

that
so
many
rabbits
in
one
apartment
would
be
difficult
for
various
reasons.
She
shrugged
it
off.
Then
one
day,
she
started
saying
how
she
was
catching
wild
rabbits
because,
in
her
own
words,
'they
were
all
abandoned
and
bunnies
aren't
actually
wild
animals.'I
said
that
was
cruel
and
irresponsible
to
take
wild
rabbits,
both
adults
and
babies,
into
her
apartment
and
treat
them
as
pets
and
that
they
aren't
the
same
as
domesticated
rabbits.
She
got
mad
at
me
and
told
me
to
mind
my
own
buisness
and
that
she
knew
they
needed
her
protection.Honestly,
I'm
thinking
of
calling
animal
control
on
her.
But
what
do
you
think,
Reddit?
Was
I
out
of
line?

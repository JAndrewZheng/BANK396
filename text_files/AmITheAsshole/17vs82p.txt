Strap in folks cos this is a weird one. To
me anyway.We live on the same street as my in-laws,
my husband’s parents live a few doors down and his
sister and her husband live the other side of the
road. This means my children see their grandparents more or
less every day. About a month ago I was taking
my youngest (M11) to school and we saw his grandad,
so he waved and they chatted for a bit, and
then my son said “bye grandad, love you” and grandad
called back “have a good day at school.” In the
car, child asked me why grandad didn’t say “love you
too” and I said he was probably distracted and not
to think anything more about it. It happens again a
couple of weeks later, and again I don’t make a
big deal of it.Last night we were all round at
sister-in-law’s house, and as we’re leaving child says bye grandad,
love you and grandad says, “you’re too big to be
saying that now <child>; men only say that to their
wives.”At which point both me and my husband had a
WTF moment and I leapt in and said “grandad means
he only says it to grandma, sweetie, you can say
it to anyone you like.” And husband immediately backs me
up and says, “yeah, look - love you <nephew>” (16M)
and nephew (without looking away from the TV says “love
you too Uncle <name>.”My father in law turned red and
left. Now my sister in law says we shouldn’t have
embarraed him like that and we need to apologise. I
haven’t seen my husband’s parents yet but I really don’t
see why I should apologise, I didn’t do anything wrong
except protect my son from something that I think was
quite hurtful. AITA?

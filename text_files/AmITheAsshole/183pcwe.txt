I
(f27)
am
self-employed
and
working
from
home.
Most
of
my
friends
have
recently
had
kids
and
are
either
on
maternity
leave
or
are
stay
at
home
mums.
I
live
in
a
flat
in
a
town
centre.
One
of
my
friends,
Claire
(f28)
is
particularly
bad
about
just
coming
by
and
wanting
to
have
coffee.
I
absolutely
despite
having
people
come
over
without
letting
me
know
in
advance
but
she
seems
to
think
that
just
because
I
work
from
home,
I
have
time
to
just
sit
and
drink
coffee
on
hours
on
end.I
told
my
friends
to
not
do
that
and
most
of
them
actually
listened
or
limited
their
visits.
I’ll
admit,
I
sometimes
pretend
that
I’m
not
in
as
well
because
when
I’m
especially
busy,
I
don’t
want
to
be
distracted.
And
when
Claire
comes
over
she’s
the
person
who
doesn’t
realise
when
she
overstayed
her
welcome.She
came
over
yesterday.
It’s
Black
Friday
and
as
a
small
business
owner,
it
is
a
busy
time
period
for
me.
I’m
trying
to
stay
on
top
of
the
orders
and
she
just
dropped
by
expected
to
have
a
chat,
etc.

I
opened
the
door
and
have
had
enough,
I’ve
been
running
on
4
hours
of
sleep,
have
been
tired
and
groggy.
I
told
her
that
I
don’t
have
the
time
and
she’d
know
that
if
she
bothered
to
text
me
asking
if
she
could
come.She
said
I
was
rude
and
wasted
her
trip
and
I
said
she
did
that
herself,
she
knew
I
didn’t
appreciate
people
coming
over.She
said
she
didn’t
think
I
was
being
serious
and
asked
me
if
I
was
really
not
going
to
let
her
in.I
confirmed
and
she
basically
called
me
an
ahole
and
left.Later
on,
she
told
every
single
one
of
my
friend
and
they’ve
been
bitching
on
Facebook
about
me.
I
rarely
use
it
but
when
other
people
have
messaged
me
about
it,
I
had
to
check
what
was
going
on.
They’ve
been
slagging
me
off
and
I
basically
had
to
delete
the
app
to
still
be
able
to
work.Anyway,
they
all
seem
to
agree
that
I’m
the
ahole
and
I’m
starting
to
doubt
myself.
Should
I
have
let
her
in?
AITA?

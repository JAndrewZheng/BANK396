I am going to start off and say I never
really got the threat of if you don’t do what
I someone wants then you won’t see the grandkids. Especially
when I don’t have emotional ties to the kids for
one reason or another.So my son and his wife moved
right out of college and now came back to the
home state. They have two kids that’s are 9 and
13. I have met them four times, there really isn’t
a connection between us, I’m just a relative that they
know off. They are much closer to their other grandparents.
Now I invited them to have thanksgiving with me and
the rest of he kids. I got a call today
and my son told me that I need to make
the same stuff that the other family makes which includes
a fried turkey. I told him no and if he
would like to take it over he can and just
bring it to the home.He told me it was for
the grandkids since they won’t see their other  grandparents
this year. I told him no again, that I won’t
be making the exact same stuff.He told me if I
don’t do it I won’t see them and I told
that is fine. This started an argument and I told
him not to come. He has been blowing up my
phone since. The rest of the family is confused.Was I
the d here? Should I make the same stuff

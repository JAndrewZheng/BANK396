My
(26F)
husband
(26M)
and
I
have
been
together
for
12
years,
married
for
9.
We’ve
got
a
daughter
(2F),
and
have
a
strained
relationship
with
his
family.My
husband
has
additional
needs
(one
of
which
being
autism)
that
his
parents
refused
to
get
him
support
for
during
his
childhood
because
they
didn’t
believe
in
the
validity
of
his
conditions.
He
received
no
support
or
help
during
school,
and
really
struggled
once
he
hit
adulthood.His
relationship
with
his
family
(his
mum
and
brother
in
particular)
is
distant.
When
we
had
our
daughter,
we’d
see
his
side
of
the
family
so
much
more
often,
but
as
happens
with
babies,
once
the
initial
intrigue
dies
down,
so
do
the
visits.At
first
I
made
nearly
all
of
the
efforts
in
maintaining
the
relationship.
I’d
send
photos
5-6x
a
day,
I’d
organise
when
who
could
come
over
(messy
divorce
so
it’s
hard
to
have
both
at
the
same
time),
and
would
coordinate
group
outings.
It’s
hard
since
there’s
always
cancellations
without
letting
us
know
and
my
MIL
would
always
be
late
without
letting
us
know,
which
would
affect
mealtimes
and
bathtimes
since
she
came
after
work.My
daughter’s
first
Christmas
was
horrific
for
me,
trying
to
plan
two
families,
and
try
to
still
enjoy
myself.
Eventually
I
confided
in
my
husband
that
I
was
exhausted
with
being
the
only
one
to
try,
and
he
told
me
to
stop.I
did,
and
it
led
to
a
huge
blow
out,
where
my
MIL
eventually
stated
my
scheduling
of
visits
was
too
stressful,
the
facetime
calls
each
day
were
intrusive,
and
requested
she
be
the
one
to
be
in
control.
I
happily
gave
it
up,
on
the
condition
she
gave
us
notice.
This
was
January
of
2023.This
year
we
have
seen
her
in
person
6
times,
with
the
last
visit
being
in
August
of
2023.
We’ve
had
no
FaceTimes
that
we
didn’t
initiate
(and
we
only
did
this
during
huge
milestones—walking,
first
word),
and
every
visit
she
has
arranged
she
has
cancelled.At
the
beginning
of
November,
she
invited
us
to
a
family
dinner
that
would
occur
at
the
start
of
December.
My
husband
isn’t
close
to
his
extended
family
(his
mum
moved
closer
to
them
during
his
adulthood
and
reconnected,
but
due
to
his
autism
he
has
struggled
to
form
the
connections),
but
eagerly
agreed.
We
bought
outfits,
joined
the
secret
santa
etc,
and
then
at
11pm
that
night
she
messaged
and
said
she’s
really
worried
it
would
be
awkward
and
would
we
mind
not
coming.I
was
upset,
mainly
because
my
husband
was,
but
of
course
understood
it’s
better
to
not
go
somewhere
we
weren’t
wanted.Now,
Christmas
plans
will
be
happening
and
last
year
was
so
traumatic
for
me,
that
I’m
considering
not
having
her
come
over
at
all.
My
child
doesn’t
know
who
she
is,
there’s
no
connection
there,
and
she’s
very
shy
and
timid
around
new
people.My
husband
doesn’t
want
to
rock
the
boat,
but
I’m
curious
as
to
if
I’d
be
the
ahole
if
I
put
my
foot
down
and
said
she
isn’t
visiting
since
she’s
put
no
effort
in.So…
will
I?

I (M, 41) lost my wife, who was 7 months
pregnant with my son, when I was 35. I have
kept in touch with her parents through the years, despite
them being difficult, as I always thought that the pain
they have gone through cannot be easy. They didn’t like
when I started dating, which I understood, they claimed parts
of the inheritance that were legally mine, and I just
let them have it, as I wasn’t with my wife
for the money (I gave up something in the vicinity
of USD 80k), and during the first years I had
to fight their desire to control my every move: They
were constantly checkin on my whereabouts, would expect me to
console them every time they were sad, and wanted me
to keep them informed about any plans I would have…
which I don’t even do with my own parents.I got
married 3 years ago and now we are expecting twins,
2 boys!My former mother in law sends me WhatsApp messages
and greetings around 3 times per week, so, in one
of these occasions, I told her we were expecting. Her
reaction to this was to give a very short “congrats”,
Instantly followed by a claim that I should not forget
their daughter and my unborn son. She then changed the
subject.Months have gone by, and she has not checked on
the pregnancy once, let alone checking on how I’m doing
now with all that. It is an abnormally scary experience
for me, since I lost my wife the last time,
but also because I am a little bit older now
(41), so the energy is not the same, and also
because it’s TWINS.I feel this is a one way, energy
draining relationship, where they ask and ask from me, but
never even care for a second about me as a
person or my well being. As if I was some
sort of placeholder for the love they had for their
daughter, but couldn’t care less for my life or what
is going on with me, so I am thinking in
just talking to them, and end the relationship.AITA????

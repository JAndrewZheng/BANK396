My husband (38m) has two children(9f and 11m) from a
previous relationship, we also have two kids together (2m and
a 3-week-old daughter). My husband and I started our relationship
6 years ago, we moved in pretty quickly. A year
after our relationship, his ex moved to Bali to start
a business. The kids were supposed to be with us
for 6 months and they’d go to Bali to live
with their mother. Unfortunately due to her financial circumstances, the
kids could never go to Bali.Initially, the kids had a
hard time adjusting to me and being away from their
mom. To make them adjust better to the change my
husband did activities with them without me. This really helped
my stepson adjust better, but my stepdaughter was still having
a hard time. I started to take her with me
to get our hair and nails done. After our spa
day together we usually go out to a bakery for
lunch. Then we just go shopping, get takeout, and end
the day with a movie night. She really enjoyed our
time together and, she really changed and became more comfortable
with me.My husband’s ex temporarily came back two weeks ago.
My stepdaughter had this dark pink nail polish on, and
her mother was not happy about it. to keep it
short she not so nicely asked me to stop the
spa weekends or else. I told my stepdaughter that we
unfortunately can’t do our spa weekends anymore, but that I’d
still take her to the bakery for lunch, just not
doing our hair and nails anymore. She was of course
very upset, but she’ll probably get over it.My husband is
the one who’s extremely angry. I tried to talk to
him and explain that I was just following their mom’s
lead. As a parent, he should understand why I’m not
doing the spa day with her. AITA?

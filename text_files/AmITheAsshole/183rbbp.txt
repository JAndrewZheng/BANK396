So
my
(now
ex)
boyfriend
27m,
had
gone
through
my
computer,
and
found
some
pictures
of
my
ex-boyfriend
from
10
years
ago.
I
did
not
know
that
they
where
still
there,
so
he
had
to
be
snooping
around.
Offcourse
i
understand,
that
it
is
distressing
to
find
pictures
like
that,
but
now
he
is
positive
that
I
still
have
feelings
for
my
ex,
even
though
i
really
fon’t
have.
He
is
calling
me
disgutting,
manipulating,
and
says
that
the
only
chance
we
have
moving
forward,
is
if
I
come
crawling
back
for
forgiveness.
I
am
hurt
by
his
namecalling,
and
don’t
think
I
deserve
it.
He
has
a
habit
of
being
very
jelaous
and
suspicious
of
many
things
I
do,
even
though
I
would
never
dream
of
doing
anything
to
hurt
him.But
now
I
am
starting
to
doupt
myself.
AITA?Sorry
for
bad
language,
english
isn’t
my
first.

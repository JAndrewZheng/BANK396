I (50m) have a daughter (16f) who got a job
as a waitress. She has special needs so it was
really nice for her to find a workplace that was
very accommodating and flexible. She did this to try and
save money up. At first I was proud of her
and happy. I thought her uniform was a little short
but I didn't say anything. I let her work a
few weeks before I went by. Then, I thought I'd
pop in as a customer. When I got there I
went and sat down. While I was there I saw
lots of flirting from middle aged men to her. I
heard a man go as far as to ask something
that could be very sexual and was slightly weird for
the context (very clearly intentional) but she didn't seem to
get it (she never gets that kind of thing). When
she left to go get the "box" of condiments, I
straight up said so he could hear "she's 16." I
was met with the reply "I didn't touch her."I was
very uneased by this.  I ended up going the
next day too and it was more of the same
type of thing. I talked to my daughter and she
didn't understand what was wrong or notice anything was off.
I know some social things go over hear head especially
things like this. I decided to the workplace isn't safe
enough for her to work there. I made her quit.
She's so mad at me. Her brother's (18m, 20m, 26m)
and took her side and so are my friends. I
still feel like I did the right thing, but no
one seems to agree.

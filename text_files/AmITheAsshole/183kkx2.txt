For
some
context,
me
(24f)
and
my
brother
(31m)
have
been
living
together
for
a
few
months.
He
used
to
live
with
his
ex-girlfriend,
who
lived
with
her
mother
and
her
grandmother,
for
a
few
years
and
she
has
a
kid,
but
then
she
broke
up
with
him
and
just
in
that
time
I
moved
out
of
my
parent's
house
because
I
was
able
to
buy
a
house
thanks
to
my
grandma's
inheritance.
Since
my
brother
had
nowhere
to
go
and
he
needed
to
stay
in
the
city
because
of
his
work,
I
told
him
to
move
in
with
me
for
a
few
months
since
I
didn't
want
to
live
alone
in
a
new
neighbourhood
where
I
didn't
know
anyone
and
my
brother
is
more
outgoing
than
me.
Here's
the
thing
(and
I
know
a
lot
of
people
with
older
siblings
can
relate
to
this),
my
brother
has
always
taken
ownership
of
my
things,
if
I
have
something
that
he
likes
or
needs,
he
takes
it
without
asking
for
permission.
It
has
always
bothered
me
when
we
were
kids
and
we
had
awful
fights
because
of
it.
Recently,
he's
doing
the
same
thing
with
the
house,
he
always
refers
to
the
house
as
his
and
tells
everyone
that
he's
the
one
who
bought
the
house,
when
it
was
clearly
me.
It
doesn't
bother
me
that
much
because
we
don't
really
have
any
friends
in
common
because
of
our
age
difference.Now
comes
the
problem.
He
kept
in
contact
with
his
ex
because
he
has
a
really
good
relationship
with
her
kid,
but
because
of
that,
they
were
starting
to
get
close
again
and
she
regrets
breaking
up
with
him.
He
tells
me
he
doesn't
want
to
get
back
together
with
her
but
I
know
him
well
enough
to
realize
he's
still
in
love
with
her.
One
night
I
came
home
from
work
and
my
brother
told
me
that
his
ex
was
going
to
come
to
the
house
because
she
was
upset
and
had
a
fight
with
her
mother.
I
told
him
that
she
coud
come,
but
I
didn't
want
her
spending
the
night.
He
got
upset
with
me
and
started
questioning
the
reasons
why.
I
explained
him
that
I
knew
that
he
was
still
into
her
and
that
they
eventually
would
get
back
together,
and
I
if
that
happened,
I
knew
he
would
want
her
to
come
live
in
my
house
with
her
kid
and
I
didn't
want
that
to
happen.
He
told
me
I
was
overreacting
and
got
upset
with
me.
She
eventually
had
to
spend
the
night
because
there
was
a
storm
and
she
couldn't
go
back
home.
The
next
day
I
told
my
brother
that
that
was
going
to
be
the
last
time
she
spends
the
night
at
the
house
and
he
got
mad
at
me
again.
He
told
me
that
he
was
living
there
too
and
he
had
the
right
to
bring
home
whoever
he
wanted.AITA?*Note:
He's
not
helping
me
pay
for
the
bills
or
food
because
he's
been
having
a
bad
couple
of
months
at
his
work,
but
he
does
most
of
the
chores
around
the
house
since
I'm
working
and
studying
at
the
same
time.

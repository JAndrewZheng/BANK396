So
my
parents
currently
live
in
a
Duplex
house
with
my
little
brother,
they
rent
one
side,
the
other
side
is
rented
by
a
different
tenant.
The
landlord
is
selling
the
house
and
the
other
tenant
is
currently
the
one
who
is
most
likely
to
buy
it.
My
parents
really
want
to
get
it,
but
they
can't
get
approved
due
to
a
few
different
reasons,
even
though
they
could
most
likely
afford
the
house.
I
also
want
to
own
a
home
sooner
than
later,
and
would
like
to
move
back
to
the
area
where
literally
all
of
my
friends
and
family
live.
About
a
year
and
a
half
ago
now
I
moved
to
a
different
state
about
6-7
hours
away
depending
on
traffic.
I'm
thinking
of
applying
for
the
mortgage
with
them,
as
then
we
could
offer
more
than
the
other
tenant
and
be
approved
no
problem,
as
I
make
almost
as
much
as
my
two
parents
combined,
and
I
have
better
credit.
However
if
I
did
this,
it
would
be
with
the
plan
that
once
my
lease
is
up
on
my
apartment,
I
move
in
with
them
or
my
grandparents
for
a
few
months,
then
once
the
current
tenants
lease
is
up
we
don't
renew
it
and
I
move
into
the
other
half
of
the
Duplex.
I
told
a
friend
about
this
plan,
and
they
said
it'd
be
kind
of
a
d
move
to
do
to
the
tenant
currently
living
there.
Normally
I
would
agree
that
I'd
be
a
crap
person
for
doing
this,
however,
the
other
tenant
is
already
very
well
off.
She
owns
a
much
more
expensive
house
about
40
minutes
away,
and
she
only
rents
here
so
that
instead
of
having
to
commute
her
son
to
the
private
highschool
we
have
in
town,
he
can
just
walk
there
instead.
It's
not
a
cheap
private
school
either,
it's
$72k
a
year
if
the
student
boards
there,
$51k
if
they
only
attend
claes
but
don't
live
there.
It's
not
like
she
couldn't
easily
rent
elsewhere
that's
nearby,
even
if
it
was
more
expensive.
That's
my
logic
anyways,
so
I
don't
seem
to
really
understand
the
problemSo,
would
I
be
the
ahole
for
this?
TLDR:
I
wanna
buy
a
Duplex
with
my
parents,
then
when
the
rich
tenant
in
the
other
side
of
the
house
is
lease
is
up,
not
renew
it
so
that
I
could
move
into
the
other
side.

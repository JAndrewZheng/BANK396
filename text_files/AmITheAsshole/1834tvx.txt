I
(36M)
am
the
owner
of
a
Great
Pyr/Australian
Cattle
Dog
mix
named
Charlotte
(6F).
I
live
in
a
lower-middle
cla
suburb
in
an
unspecified
United
State.
I
have
lived
here
for
about
a
year
now,
and
I
let
Charlotte
out
to
go
potty
roughly
six
or
so
times
a
day.
It's
always
the
same
routine:
I
open
the
back
door,
Charlotte
runs
outside
to
pee
and
"patrol"
the
yard
(apparently
it's
a
Pyr
thing),
and
doesn't
typically
come
bounding
back
to
the
door
until
I
poke
my
head
out
and
call
her
name.About
a
week
or
two
ago
(maybe
longer
if
I
didn't
notice)
new
neighbors
moved
in
across
my
back
alley.
I
had
no
intentions
of
interacting
with
them
whatsoever,
like
ever,
except
today
when
I
was
executing
the
last
step
of
Charlotte's
aforementioned
potty
protocol.I
stuck
my
head
out
and
called
her
name,
but
this
time,
alongside
the
familiar
sounds
of
my
dog
galloping
up
the
porch
steps,
was
an
adult
human
voice
shouting
something
along
the
lines
of
"WHY
ARE
YOU
CALLING
MY
DAUGHTER??"
At
first
I
thought
it
might
just
be
my
new
neighbors
getting
into
a
spat,
until
a
couple
minutes
later
I
heard
pounding
on
my
front
door.I
opened
the
door
to
an
angry
man
about
twice
my
size
glaring
me
down.
He
said
something
like
"Why
the
eff
are
you
calling
my
daughter
into
your
house"
and
I
responded
"Your
daughter's
name
is
Charlotte?"
and
he
just
kind
of
kept
glaring
at
me??
In
absence
of
a
response
I
followed
up
with
"Charlotte
is
my
dog's
name,
dude"
and
he
rolled
his
eyes
at
me
and
said
I
"better"
change
my
dog's
name
because
he
doesn't
want
his
daughter
(2F)
getting
confused
and
running
into
my
house.I
told
him
that's
not
going
to
happen
because
not
only
did
my
dog
have
the
name
first,
we
also
lived
here
first,
plus
I
don't
like
strangers
making
demands
of
me
before
even
attempting
to
be
polite.
What
I
DIDN'T
say
but
really
wanted
to
say
is
that
teaching
his
child
stranger
danger
is
his
responsibility,
not
mine.He
called
me
stupid
and
said
that
a
human
child
obviously
has
priority
over
a
dog
for
a
name.
I
shut
the
door
in
his
face
and
stared
at
him
through
the
peephole
for
a
moment
before
he
eventually
walked
back
to
his
house.This
last
potty
break,
I
went
out
with
Charlotte
and
stayed
in
the
yard
with
her
until
she
finished
her
business,
but
this
guy
just
kind
of
stood
in
his
yard
with
his
arms
crossed
and
glared
at
me
the
entire
time.TLDR:
I
think
it's
unfair
that
this
father
demands
I
change
my
dog's
name
just
because
he
chose
the
same
name
for
his
kid
\[RUDE
AND
UNNECESSARY
COMMENT
REDACTED\].
But
on
the
other
hand,
most
humans
think
humans
have
priority
over
dogs
for
just
about
everything.
AITA?

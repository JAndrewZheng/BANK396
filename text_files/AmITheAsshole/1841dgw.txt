I
(15f)
was
born
when
my
parents
were
18
and
19
during
their
freshman
year
at
college.

It
was
unplanned,
but
my
dad
wanted
to
keep
me
but
my
bio
mom
"Annie"
didn't,
so
they
made
a
compromise
where
Annie
didn't
abort
me
and
would
instead
sign
away
all
of
her
rights
to
my
dad
who
would
have
full
custody.Annie
and
my
dad
didn't
really
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
time
at
college,
and
Annie
requested
that
my
dad
not
contact
her
since
she
was
moving
from
their
hometown.

My
grandparents
were
the
main
people
helping
out
my
dad
as
I
grew
up,
and
my
dad
told
me
what
happened
when
I
was
thirteen
after
I
asked
about
it,
because
he
started
dating
my
soon-to-be
stepmom,
Madison.I
resented
Annie
a
little
bit
for
not
being
around
before
realizing
it
was
better
to
not
have
her
in
my
life
since
she
didn't
want
me.
Besides,
if
she
was
still
around,
my
dad
might've
not
met
his
fiance
who
I
consider
my
mom
already.Recently,
Annie
has
reached
out
to
my
dad
about
reconnecting
with
him
and
me.
My
dad
shot
down
the
reconnecting
with
him
part,
because
of
Maddison
but
he
was
open
to
letting
her
reconnect
with
me
as
long
as
I
wanted
to
know
her.Madison
was
not
open
to
this
and
thought
Annie
would
just
hurt
me,
but
my
dad
convinced
her
that
we
could
cut
her
back
out
of
our
lives
since
she
didn't
have
any
rights
anyway.

After
a
long
talk,
I
agreed
to
meet
her
out
of
curiosity
about
what
she's
been
up
to.For
some
reason,
my
dad
decided
to
invite
Annie
to
our
Thanksgiving
dinner
rather
than
schedule
a
meeting
at
Red
Lobster
or
something.

I
thought
it
was
strange,
but
didn't
say
anything.

It
was
a
bit
awkward
at
first,
but
we
eventually
started
talking
more
freely
during
dinner.
I
did
dodge
some
more
personal
questions,
but
I
thought
it
was
a
good
conversation
overall.After
my
grandparents
left,
Annie
was
still
there
and
we
started
to
load
the
food
into
the
fridge.
Annie
offered
to
help
so
my
dad
and
Madison
let
her
get
the
food
into
tupperware
containers
alongside
me.It
was
silent
before
Annie
broke
it
by
complaining
that
I
treated
her
like
a
stranger
rather
than
my
mother
and
that
I
wasn't
very
emotional.

I
was
kinda
stunned
by
the
"treating
her
like
a
stranger"
part,
and
I
only
asked
what
did
she
expect.Annie
looked
like
she
was
going
to
protest
or
something
before
my
dad
said
it
was
best
that
she
get
home
since
it
was
getting
dark,
and
we'd
finished
cleaning
up
by
ourselves.

Annie
left,
and
we
finished
cleaning
up.My
dad
stopped
me
before
I
went
to
my
bedroom,
and
said
that
my
response
was
kinda
callous
and
that
I
should
more
empathetic
to
Annie
because
it
must've
taken
a
lot
of
courage
for
her
to
reach
out.

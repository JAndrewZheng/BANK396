I work from home and my girlfriend works in a
hospital. Since I work from home I normally do most
of the household chores and what not. Last weekend I
was telling my girlfriend how I was feeling overwhelmed with
work and all the things I do around the house
and I asked her to help out once in a
while.   She said she would try to help
out more and told me she would make a surprise
meal for the week. My girlfriend gave me a list
of groceries she would need and I bought it all
on Sunday.  She didn't cook on Sunday because it
was too late at night for her to cook and
she didn't cook on Monday because when she got home
from work, she was too tired to get started. This
is where the conflict started. When she came home yesterday
she was in a bad mood and got mad that
there weren't any leftovers. She told me how it's ridiculous
why I think it's fair for her to come home
from work and be expected to cook. I pointed out
how she said she would do it and even asked
me to buy the groceries for her. She said I
shouldn't expect this of her because she will always be
too tired to cook right when she comes home from
work and I should have known that.  I told
her how unfair she was being and that she is
playing games by expecting me to read her mind to
know that when she says one thing she means the
other thing. She said I was being a bad partner
for not thinking about what she would need from me
and that in not providing her with food when she
comes home then I am just failing.  She is
at work right and I am so pissed that I
really just want to break up. Am I crazy here?EDIT:
hello everyone, thank you for all of your responses. I
am going to post an update at some point but
I've decided I am going to break up. I've reached
my breaking point and I don't want to live like
this anymore. My friends are going to help me move
my stuff to his place. I will update when it's
all over.

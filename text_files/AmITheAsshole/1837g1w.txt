Last
Saturday,
me,
my
3
year
old
daughter
and
my
Mum
went
to
the
next
town
over
for
a
day
of
shopping.

It
is
summer
at
the
moment
in
my
country
and
where
we
live
gets
really
hot.
After
seeing
a
movie
we
are
walking
back
to
my
car
which
is
in
the
sun
on
the
roof
carpark.
We
run
into
an
old
friend
of
my
Mum
who
lives
in
the
same
town
as
her
and
they
start
talking.
I
am
politely
standing
in
the
hot
sun
with
my
daughter
for
10
minutes
listening
to
the
two
of
them
talk.
My
daughter
starts
fidgeting
and
getting
grumpy.
I
recognize
that
she
is
overheating
and
needs
to
get
in
the
shade.
I
tell
my
Mum
we
have
to
get
Daughter
into
the
shade
and
can
she
chat
with
her
friend
at
home.
My
Mum
snaps
at
me
that
I
need
to
'teach
daughter
to
be
patient
and
respectful
when
adults
are
speaking'.


This
was
the
story
for
my
entire
childhood.
My
Mum
is
very
inconsiderate
of
myself
and
my
siblings
needs.
Whenever
she
would
run
into
a
friend
she
would
make
us
wait
in
a
hotcar
or
in
the
heat
while
she
chats
to
them
for
30
minutes.
When
we
were
in
long
car
rides
and
we
needed
to
pee
she
would
make
us
wait
until
we
got
to
our
destination.
I
remember
peeing
myself
a
couple
of
times
because
of
this
and
she
would
scold
me
for
peeing
myself
on
purpose.
I
remember
going
the
entire
day
without
food
besides
breakfast
if
we
were
out
running
errands
and
her
refusing
to
take
us
home
and
feed
us
or
buy
us
food
to
eat.
She
would
spend
hours
on
the
phone
talking
to
her
friends
and
ignoring
us
kids
and
if
we
dared
ask
her
for
something
she
would
snap
at
us
to
leave
her
alone
and
complain
about
how
she
never
gets
time
to
herself.
The
conversation
and
her
comments
triggered
me
and
I
got
really
angry.
I
promptly
took
my
daughter
to
the
car
and
started
to
drive
out
of
the
parking
lot.
I
stopped
by
my
Mum
and
told
her
I
was
taking
daughter
home
now
and
she
can
either
come
with
us
now
or
find
another
way
home.
She
laughed
at
me
and
said
to
stop
being
dramatic
and
she
would
take
as
long
as
she
needed
with
her
friend.
I
think
she
thought
I
was
bluffing
and
would
pull
over
and
wait
for
her.
Instead
I
drove
off
without
her
and
got
a
call
20
minutes
later
asking
where
I
was
over.
I
told
her
I
was
on
my
way
home
and
for
her
to
get
another
ride.

I
didn't
listen
to
the
rest
and
hung
up
on
her.
I
got
a
text
from
her
that
night
saying
how
I
acted
disrespected
her
and
left
her
stranded
(her
friend
left
before
she
realized
I
was
gone
and
didnt
answer
the
phone
while
driving).
I
told
my
Mum
I
wasn't
going
to
let
my
kid
pa
out
from
heat
exhaustion
because
she
wanted
to
flap
her
jaws
for
an
hour.
I
also
brought
up
the
previous
things
and
told
her
she
needs
to
think
about
other
peoples
needs
over
her
wants.
We
got
into
a
big
row
and
she
said
I
crossed
a
big
line
leaving
her
stranded
even
if
the
other
stuff
was
true.
Now
that
I've
cooled
down
a
bit
I
am
feeling
guilty
for
what
I
did
and
not
bringing
it
up
in
a
more
mature
way.
AITA?

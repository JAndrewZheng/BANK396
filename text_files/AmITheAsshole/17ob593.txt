Last night my girlfriend and I had 8 friends over
for dinner, drinks, etc. Pretty usual Saturday night fun. We
are all in our thirties (if that matters), some different
nationalities, religions, and all currently living and working in London,
UK. Note though I'm not currently drinking so was sober.
   The conversation turned to politics and a
conflict that is currently getting a lot of attention. I'm
being intentionally vague here. This is not what the post
is about.    It got heated. Usually this
group of people can discuss politics in this group and
respect each other, but comments went over the line IMO.
James said Peter didn't know anything about history, Peter said
James was supporting war crimes, James said some things back
about how his family would know about that. Other people
said other things. No one in this debate/argument looked good.
   I like a good political debate, but
it was horrible seeing this usually close group of people
who usually respect each other get so angry with one
another.    At this point I loudly said
'Enough, no politics or religion here tonight please, it's my
home, my rules for the evening.'    There
was silence for a moment, then I was accused of
supporting / not supporting the 'correct' side by Peter, James
and their partners. I was then accused of not allowing
free speech. They know from previous conversations I've said how
free speech is the most important thing, we can disagree,
but we have to allow opinions etc so I feel
they used that against me.    I then
said, 'OK but this isn't a respectful debate, it's an
angry debate, so if you can't talk about something else
then leave.'    Peter, James and their partners
left, leaving the 6 of us thinking WTF just happened.
   So, AITA for saying no politics or
religion? Should I have handled it differently? I've managed to
annoy them both by not taking a side and neither
have replied to a text I sent earlier.

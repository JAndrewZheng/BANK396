My husband has had the same shirt on all day,
walking around outside (we live in a city), eating, etc.
When he gets into bed tonight I tell him that
he needs to change or take off his shirt. I
don’t want outside/dirty clothes in bed with me. We sleep
on a queen size mattress and we are both average
size people so we often touch/are in close proximity while
sleeping. I just think it’s gross and want to keep
our bed a clean space. If it were just his
space that would be one thing, but I also sleep
in this bed. He gets very upset with me and
tells me to leave him alone. I persist and he
eventually changes it but he’s very upset with me. AITA?

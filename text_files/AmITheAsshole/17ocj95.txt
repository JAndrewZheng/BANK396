My wife is catholic and I'm not particularly religious. I
could be described as agnostic. Before we got married I
made it clear to her that I'm not religious and
not to expect me to go to church or participate
in other religious rituals. She said she was okay with
me not being religious and she wasn't going to expect
me to behave as such. After I refused to go
with her to church today when she asked, she reminded
me that I asked her to go places with me
all the time, and she conflated those times to what
she's asking of me now. She mentioned that she went
with me places even when she didn't want to and
now I should do the same for her. Previously, I
mentioned to her that going to church for me isn't
something I take lightly. I told her that I will
not go to church unless I'm 100% committed to practicing
a particular religion , and I'm just not there yet.
Today, she kept saying "It's not going to change anything
for you, you should just come because I asked you
to".Part of me feels bad that I don't want to
do something she's essentially begging me to do, but at
the same time I don't want to go because I
feel like I'd be lying to myself, the church community,
and God by being present when I'm not fully committed.
AITA?

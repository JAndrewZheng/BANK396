AITA
for
Not
Wanting
to
Help
My
Sibling
with
Their
Financial
Problems?my
sibling
is
constantly
facing
various
financial
troubles,
and
they
expect
me
to
bail
them
out
every
single
time.
I'm
starting
to
question
if
I'm
being
a
heartless
jerk
by
refusing
to
help
them
out
anymore.My
sibling
(30F)
has
always
been
a
bit
impulsive
when
it
comes
to
managing
money.
They
frequently
make
reckless
financial
decisions,
such
as
taking
expensive
vacations,
buying
luxury
items
they
can't
afford,
and
not
saving
for
emergencies.
This
behavior
has
landed
them
in
a
tight
spot
multiple
times,
and
each
time,
they
come
running
to
me,
their
younger
sister
(28F),
for
help.At
the
beginning,I
sympathized
with
their
situation
and
did
whatever
I
could
to
help
them
out.
I
lent
them
money,
allowed
them
to
stay
with
me
when
they
couldn't
afford
rent,
and
even
covered
some
of
their
bills.
However,
it
has
now
become
a
recurring
pattern,
and
I
feel
like
I'm
enabling
their
irresponsible
behavior
instead
of
letting
them
learn
from
their
mistakes.Recently,
they
approached
me
again,
needing
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
pay
off
credit
card
debt
that
they
accrued
through
impulsive
shopping
sprees.
This
time,
I
couldn't
bring
myself
to
say
yes,
as
their
financial
problems
are
becoming
a
heavy
burden
on
me.
I've
been
working
hard
to
build
my
own
financial
stability
and
save
for
my
future,
and
continuously
bailing
them
out
is
hindering
my
progress.I
understand
that
family
is
supposed
to
support
each
other
during
tough
times,
but
I
feel
like
I've
exhausted
all
my
resources
while
they
show
no
signs
of
changing
their
habits.
It's
frustrating
because
I've
tried
talking
to
them
about
budgeting,
seeking
financial
advice,
and
making
conscious
decisions,
but
nothing
seems
to
get
through.
I
don't
want
to
resent
my
sibling,
but
I
also
don't
want
to
enable
their
reckless
behavior
anymore.am
I
the
jerk
for
wanting
to
draw
a
line
and
stop
financially
supporting
my
sibling?
Should
I
continue
stepping
in
despite
the
negative
effect
it
has
on
my
own
life,
or
is
it
finally
time
for
them
to
take
responsibility
for
their
actions?My
sibling
consistently
makes
poor
financial
decisions
and
relies
on
me
for
help.
I'm
tired
of
enabling
their
irresponsibility
and
want
to
stop
providing
financial
aistance.
AITA?

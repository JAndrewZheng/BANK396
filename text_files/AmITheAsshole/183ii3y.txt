My
friend
Leah
(42
f)
has
three
kids
with
her
husband
Greg
(43
m).
The
two
older
ones
are
very
pleasant
to
be
around
and
overall
what
you
would
call
"good
kids".
Then
there
is
Max
(5
m).
He
terrorizes
his
sister
and
brother,
needs
attention
24/7
and
Leah
encourages
it.
She
calls
him
"her
favourite
last
baby
boy".
Whatever
he
does
to
anyone
she
brushes
off
with
"I
just
can't
be
mad
at
my
favorite
last
baby
boy".

She
says
things
like
that
in
front
of
the
older
ones
and
you
would
have
to
be
blind
not
to
see
how
much
it
hurts
them.
I've
been
watching
this
whole
situation
for
the
last
two
years
and
never
said
a
word
because
I
don't
believe
in
policing
other
people's
parenting
and
I
think
it's
Greg's
job
to
check
her
on
that.
He
tries
but
failed
so
far.
Along
comes
Thanksgiving.
We
had
23
guests
including
Leah's
family.
We
were
all
sitting
at
the
table
and
Max
started
yelling
every
time
the
attention
of
the
whole
table
wasn't
on
him.
And
I
don't
mean
talking
loud
I
mean
just
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
lungs.
He
wanted
everyone
to
watch
him
dance,
then
listen
to
the
story
of
him
beating
the
crap
out
of
a
kid
at
soccer
practice,
then
playing
with
and
throwing
around
food,
then
cried
when
people
ignored
his
demand
everyone
should
say
they
are
thankful
for
him
being
cute
like
his
mommy
when
we
said
what
we
were
thankful
for
this
year.
I
first
looked
at
Leah
and
Greg
to
make
sure
they
understood
I
wasn't
cool
with
that.
He
tried
to
shut
him
down
but
Leah
encouraged
him
and
told
him
how
funny
and
cute
he
was.
Other
people
tried
to
gently
shut
him
down
and
have
conversations
until
my
husband
then
got
more
specific
and
told
him
he
can
either
let
the
other
people
eat
and
talk
in
peace
or
go
and
eat
with
the
other
kids
at
the
kids
table
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
first
place.
Leah
looked
super
pissed
and
went
with
him
to
the
kids
table.
I
was
relieved
and
thought
that
was
the
end
of
it.
She
left
fairly
early
with
him
but
the
rest
of
the
family
stayed
and
everyone
seemed
happy.
This
morning
I
got
a
call
from
Leah.
She
told
me
we
were
horrible
hosts
and
this
would
be
the
last
time
they
would
come
for
Thanksgiving.
Just
to
clarify:
She
actually
is
a
successful,
smart
and
fun
person
I
love.
But
that
kind
of
broke
the
camel's
back.
I
put
on
my
nurse
voice
and
calmly
told
her
that
I
can't
be
a
good
host
just
to
Max
and
she
has
to
understand
that
her
encouraging
his
behaviors
is
not
helping
him
but
raising
him
to
be
either
a
person
nobody
likes
or
even
worse
a
narcissist.
She
hung
up
and
I
haven't
tried
calling
her
back.
My
husband
says
I
did
the
right
thing
and
just
said
what
everyone
in
the
friend
group
has
been
thinking
for
years
but
I
feel
bad
for
being
so
direct.
So
am
I
the
Asshole?

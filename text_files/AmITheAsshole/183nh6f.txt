I
know
this
sounds
kinda
sucky,
but
I
have
my
reasons.
My
(16)
mothers
(45f)
brother
always
hosts
a
second
thanksgiving
at
his
house
a
few
days
after
thanksgiving.
I’m
not
really
sure
why,
but
he
does.
He
and
I
butt
heads
a
lot
because
we
have
very
different
political
views
and
things
like
that.
Not
only
that,
but
I’m
not
out
to
him
(I’m
nonbinary)
or
his
girlfriend/her
family,
as
I’m
not
sure
how
accepting
they
are.
I
also
don’t
socialize
well
and
there
is
no
one
else
there
my
age,
so
more
often
then
not
I
end
up
being
a
free
babysitter
for
my
younger
siblings
and
my
cousins,
who
all
four
of
are
young
children
(ranging
from
ages
3-8)
which
is
incredibly
overwhelming.
I
also
haven’t
really
had
any
time
to
myself
during
my
break
(which
started
on
Wednesday)
and
I
was
hoping
I
could
stay
home
so
I
could
have
time
to
myself
today.I
asked
my
mother
about
not
going
a
couple
days
beforehand
and
she
(very
begrudgingly)
said
ok.
But
just
a
few
minutes
ago,
she
came
and
asked
me
to
go
again,
saying
that
people
want
to
see
me.
She
knows
firsthand
that
there’s
no
one
there
who
actually
talks
to
me
since
I
spent
the
entire
time
last
year
pretty
much
glued
to
her
side
or
babysitting.
So
AITA?

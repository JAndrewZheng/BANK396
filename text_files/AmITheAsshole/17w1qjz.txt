Here’s some background-  my SO (34 M) cheated on
me (32 F) back in California where we previously lived.
We were broken up for 2yrs before we made our
way back to each other. During that break, I had
a 2month long fling with a guy I became friends
with. Things didn’t work out, no big deal, we remained
friends because he was part of my friend group. Since
being back together we decided to move to another state
to “start over” in our relationship. He got a cool
new job where he travels a lot but my job
is still based out of California. Today I got an
email for my company holiday dinner so I told him
I want to travel to California for that weekend since
the dinner is on a Friday. Well… hes not very
happy about it. For starters, he doesn’t understand why he
can’t come. And it’s not that he can’t, I just
would like to have the time away. I watch him
travel all the time alone so why can’t I? Secondly,
he’s really upset at the thought of me seeing my
friends. Particularly the guy I had a fling with. So,
AITA for still wanting to do this trip without him?
We had a huge fight over it but I’m currently
standing my ground.

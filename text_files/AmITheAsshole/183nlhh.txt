**EDIT:**
It
was
not
just
my
children,
but
she
does
hate
them
anyway.
She's
hardly
ever
seen
them
ever
since
they
were
born.
So
when
I
said
"it
sounded
like
an
insult"
it
was
accurate
because
she
*does*
dislike
them
although
she
is
against
all
children.
She
had
also
once
called
them
"crotch
goblins"
on
one
of
the
rare
occasions
that
they
did
met.Okay,
so
another
edit
as
people
seem
to
be
accusing
me
of
"forcing"
them
into
it.
I
never
did.
I
respect
her
choice.
I
never
asked
her
to
include
them
or
ask
her
to
hold
it
in
a
child-free
manner.
I
only
said
I
do
not
want
to
attend
as
it's
child-free
and
as
she
hates
my
kids
(which
is
true
as
she's
called
them
names
like
"crotch
goblins",
among
others).She
had
also
made
the
invite
in
front
of
my
kids
by
asking
them
to
be
excluded.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_My
(31)
sister
Laura
(29
F)
was
getting
married.
As
she's
child-free,
she
informed
all
of
us
that
she
does
not
want
any
kids/children
at
her
wedding.
My
other
siblings
were
fine
with
it,
as
they
either
did
not
have
kids
(were
child-free
themselves)
or
they
agreed
to
drop
them
off
at
home.She
had
informed
us
by
saying
that
she
and
her
boyfriend
David
wanted
to
get
married
and
also
set
the
date,
but
later
mentioned
that
she
wanted
it
to
be
child-free
so
that
no
one
would
bring
them.I
was
not
agreeable
to
that.
I
told
her
that
while
I
respect
her
choice
to
not
have
children,
I
cannot
attend
her
wedding
when
she's
clearly
said
"Do
not
bring
your
kids"
as
that
practically
sounds
like
an
insult.
I
mentioned
that
I
do
not
want
to
do
so
when
she
clearly
dislikes
my
children
enough
to
want
them
to
be
present
there.
I
have
a
pair
of
twins,
a
boy
and
a
girl,
aged
11.She
did
not
take
it
well.
She
began
to
yell
at
me
by
saying
that
she
wants
everyone
to
be
present
there
and
said
things
like
"We
have
not
had
any
issues
before,
and
it's
ridiculous
of
you
to
pull
something
like
this",
etc.
But
I
did
not
back
down
and
said
that
I
do
not
want
to
argue.
I
said
"Look,
if
you
want
it
to
be
child-free,
I
do
not
want
to
attend.
Your
option
is
to
make
do
with
the
others
now."She
was
protesting,
but
in
the
end
she
got
mad
enough
and
is
not
talking
to
me
now.
My
parents
are
calling
me
names
as
well
by
saying
that
I
should
have
attended
it.
The
wedding's
over
and
I
did
not
go
there.
But
everyone's
saying
that
I
should
have
respected
her
wishes,
which
made
me
think
that
I
did
something
wrong.AITA?

I (27f) work in an office along with Jack (around
the same age). Growing up I've never been into superheroes,
starwars or most things like that, I used to just
think of them like a guy hobby, however over the
last few years I have been wtaching more and more
superhero and scifi shows. At work I was talking with
my colleagues (including Jack) about the shows and movies we've
watched and he said that he used to watch 
alot of superhero shows but doesn't watch anymore, according to
him, they just weren't for him anymore. He said that
he usually checks reviews for most shows these days before
watching them because he ends up not liking most of
them anyway. I found this odd, and the only reason
that I could think of was because there were alot
more women in the newer shows. He had also previously
talked with another guy about some anime and he didn't
watch it because it was about little girls fighting. I
jokingly asked him if it was because there were more
women in the newer shows and he got uncomfortable. He
accused me of being judgemental on no basis when I
had just jokingly asked him. Even our other colleagues later
said that I was needless accusatory and confrontational while I
didn't think I was.

I
(f
23)
recently
inherited
a
good
amount
of
money
from
our
late
mom.
My
brother
(m
27)
and
I
were
close,
but
I
was
always
the
one
who
took
care
of
our
mom
in
her
final
years
sacrificing
a
lot
of
time
and
my
own
savings
to
ensure
she
had
the
best
care.Now
my
brother
feels
entitled
to
a
share
and
he

claims
it's
only
fair
to
split
it
equally
among
us.
However
I
feel
that
I
should
keep
the
inheritance
since
I
was
the
one
who
made
significant
sacrifices
and
devoted
my
resources
to
care
for
our
mother.I
understand
heâ€™s
family
but
I
can't
shake
the
feeling
that
I'm
being
taken
advantage
of
after
everything
I
did.
AITA
for
wanting
to
keep
the
inheritance
to
myself?

So 2 years ago my girlfriend gifted me a pair
of Jordans that I she knew I liked for my
birthday. Fast forward to today, we are planning to move
to a new apartment by the end of the month
because our current lease is ending. I’m the only one
working right now because she just finished school a couple
months ago and still looking for work.I decided to sell
the shoes this month because I’m almost the sole provider
for us right now and one, I need every dollar
possible for moving and two, they’ve gotten a big scuff
and some wear and tear from semi-frequent use because I
would wear them a lot. She saw one of my
ads for the shoes, said her feelings were hurt, and
not really talking to me or wants to be in
the same room right now.I can understand the part about
her feelings being hurt initially because at the least I
could of told her I was selling the shoes first.
Personally, something like this would not offend me so when
selling the shoes I overlooked how it would effect her
emotionally. This happened last night and she still is distancing
herself from me currently. Is this something to let linger
for days?

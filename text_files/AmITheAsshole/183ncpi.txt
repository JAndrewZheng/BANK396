Hi
all,My
husband
has
a
very
stressful
work
from
him
job.
He
often
gets
calls
and
has
to
answer
them
with
a
few
minutes
notice.
As
a
result,
he
will
run
the
shower
for
30
minutes
or
longer
before
getting
in.
He
turns
the
shower
temperature
all
the
way
up
and
fills
the
house
with
hot
steam.
We
have
a
small
bathroom
with
a
broken
fan
so
the
moisture
buildup
has
literally
caused
our
door
to
warp
and
our
crapty
quality
cabinets
to
fall
apart.
I
am
currently
holding
the
cabinets
together
with
Gorilla
glue.
I
had
fixed
the
door
by
sanding
it
down
a
few
months
ago,
but
the
constant
exposure
to
steam
in
a
closed
environment
is
causing
it
to
warp
again.
We
also
live
in
a
high
desert,
so
it
really
makes
me
uncomfortable
to
waste
that
much
water.
It
also
makes
our
entire
house
(one
floor)
really
hot
and
humid
to
the
point
I
have
to
open
windows
in
the
winter.He
says
it’s
because
he
needs
to
be
able
to
shower
at
a
moment’s
notice.
But
we
have
a
modern,
tankless
hot
water
heater.
So
it
literally
takes
10
seconds
for
the
water
to
heat
up.
He
insists
I’m
being
neurotic
by
getting
on
his
case
about
water,
which
in
his
words,
“is
basically
free.”
(We
pay
$30-$40/month
for
it,
but
we
share
the
bill
with
other
HOA
members
so
our
actual
use
doesn’t
affect
the
cost
as
directly).
So,
I
make
him
turn
it
off
after
30
minutes
without
using
it.
Am
I
the
ahole?Edit:
no
need
for
extreme
comments
telling
me
to
leave
my
husband.
I
love
my
husband
very
much
and
he
is
everything
to
me.
I
just
think
he
is
being
unreasonable
calling
me
neurotic
for
turning
the
water
off!
Thanks
for
the
supportive
comments.Update:
Showed
my
husband
this
post.
He
says
I
can
turn
it
off
for
him
whenever
I’d
like.
Thanks
y’all!

My
“friend”
borrowed
my
car
back
in
May.
It
was
apparently
hit
in
a
parking
lot
and
suffered
some
damage
to
the
front
left
corner.
The
initial
quote
to
get
it
fixed
was
$1,800.00
CAD.



She
claimed
she
couldn’t
afford
that
(even
sent
me
screen
shots
of
her
empty
bank
accounts)
and
was
planning
on
shopping
around
for
a
more
reasonable
quote.
I’m
cool
with
this
and
give
her
a
ton
of
availability
to
take
the
car
as
I
don’t
use
it
that
often.
There’s
initially
a
lot
of
back
and
forth
and
she
initially
seems
genuinely
keen
to
get
the
situation
rectified
despite
being
so
poor.
I
even
offered
to
use
my
line
of
credit
and
do
some
sort
of
payment
plan
with
her
but
she
insisted
she
was
going
to
get
some
other
quotes.



As
of
today,
I
haven’t
heard
from
her
in
2
months
and
my
car
is
still
not
fixed….
and
the
kicker
-
she’s
been
posting
stories
on
instagram
of
her
with
her
lashes/nails
done,
out
for
drinks/brunches,
and
even
on
trips
to
California
and
Florida!!!



She’s
the
type
that
monitors
her
stats
on
IG
so
I
know
she
sees
me
seeing
these
stories.
I’ve
had
to
mute
her
because
they
recently
became
so
triggering.!



Anyway,
I’m
at
the
point
where
I’m
about
to
call
her
out
but
wanted
to
touch
base
with
my
fellow
Redditors
first
to
see
what
you
all
think?
I
obviously
want
to
be
the
bigger
person
and
want
the
damages
paid
for,
but
I’m
also
feeling
really
disrespected
and
want
her
to
know
that.
I
don’t
care
about
salvaging
the
friendship
at
this
point.





So,
AITA
for
expecting
her
to
cover
the
damages
to
my
car
when
she
borrowed
it

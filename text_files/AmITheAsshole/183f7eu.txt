When
the
bulk
of
my
generation
of
cousins
were
16-19
we
started
a
yearly
tradition
of
a
"cousin
walk"
at
Thanksgiving.
For
people
familiar,
a
"cousin
walk"
happens
with
a
group
of
teenage/adult
cousins
where
there
are
certain
conversations
and
activities
that
maybe
aren't
appropriate
for
older
or
younger
relatives.
At
the
time,
there
were
only
3
that
were
under
16:
a
14
year
old,
a
4
year
old,
and
a
baby.14
is
kind
of
pushing
it,
but
with
the
age
differences,
it
seemed
mean
and
stupid
to
leave
the
14
year
old
out
and
it
would
draw
more
attention,
so
we
brought
her
with
us.
This
became
a
yearly
tradition.
The
two
youngest
would
ask
to
go,
but
we
always
said
it
was
an
older
cousin/older
kid
thing
and
everyone
accepted
it.
This
Thanksgiving,
that
4
year
old
is
now
14.
We
went
to
go
on
our
walk
as
usual,
and
this
time
my
aunts
really
didn't
accept
that
he
couldn't
come
because
we
let
Sheila
(fake
name)
come
when
she
was
14
so
he's
clearly
old
enough
now
and
should
"be
included".
NO.
He's
too
young,
and
it's
not
appropriate.
Sheila
was
too
young,
but
it
was
"vaguely
pushing
it"
young
with
the
rest
of
us
being
very
close
in
age.
Now
we're
all
in
our
20s
being
asked
to
include
a
kid.
Also,
not
for
nothing,
but
all
of
us
(including
her)
were
in
high
school
when
this
started.
This
was
all
teenagers,
not
20
somethings
and
a
middle
schooler.
She
kept
pushing
and
wouldn't
understand
why
we
were
being
so
"mean"
and
not
including
him,
and
of
course
we
couldn't
admit
exactly
why.
We
were
eventually
let
go,
but
she's
been
all
over
the
family
group
chat
about
how
awful
we
are
and
how
we
are
all
lacking
in
family
values
if
we
are
so
exclusive.
I
don't
think
we're
in
the
wrong.
Having
an
adult
cousin
only
activity
isn't
inappropriate.
There's
just
too
much
of
an
age
gap
that
unfortunately
there
are
two
cousin
groups.

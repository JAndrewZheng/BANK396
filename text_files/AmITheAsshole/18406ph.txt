So
this
is
gonna
b
kinda
long....

My
sister(31)
has
3
kids...11f
7f
and
3m.....the
7
year
old
has
been
complaining
of
pain
throughtout
her
body
my
sister
starts
taking
her
to
doctors
over
and
over
again
trying
to
find
out
why
they
keep
telling
her
it's
growing
pains....well
one
doctor
sends
her
to
Louisville
children's
hospital
and
they
go
in
and
put
the
7f
to
sleep
and
do
a
CT
scan
and
MRI
and
find
out
NUTHING
is
wrong
with
her....well
my
sister
isn't
satisfied
with
that
answer
I
guess....so
she
starts
posting
on
facebook
about
her
daughter
(7f)
has
cancer
saying
they
found
it
in
her
bones
and
diagnosed
her
with
osteosarcoma
and
she
is
needing
a
bone
marrow
transplant
or
whatever.....well...a
biker
group
in
our
town
and
the
Harley
Davidson
store
done
a
fundraiser
for
the
kid
(7f)
sister
got
5600
out
of
it.....well....my
mother
(neldalowery
on
tiktok)
posted
a
tiktok
video
on
tiktok
and
it
got
millions
of
views
and
she
starts
asking
for
cashap
money
and
stuff....well
the
state
TOOK
the
kid
(7f)
and
gave
her
to
the
father

and
he
reached
out
to
me
and
asked
me
if
I
could
come
see
the
kid
becuz
she
has
asked
about
me
....and
I
said

feel
like
she
needs
to
see
her
family
and
know
we
still
love
her......idk...So

ahole

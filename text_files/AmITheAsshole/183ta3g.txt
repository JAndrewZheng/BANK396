My
husband
(29M)
and
I
(27F)
have
been
together
for
3
years
now.
Within
the
past
7
months,
we’ve
welcomed
a
beautiful
baby
girl
to
our
family.
She’s
the
love
of
our
lives
and
we
couldn’t
be
happier
to
have
her.
But
my
husband
and
I
are
facing
a
disagreement
when
it
comes
to
his
habits
of
marijuana
consumption.
(We
live
in
a
state
where
it
is
legal
recreationally.)For
context,
my
husband
started
smoking
when
he
was
12.
He
became
a
habitual
marijuana
smoker.
He’s
the
type
of
smoker
who
wakes
up
and
immediately
has
to
get
high
and
then
hits
his
bowl
every
hour
until
he
falls
asleep.
He’s
spent
the
majority
of
his
life
high.
He
has
had
a
lot
of
serious
trauma
in
his
life
and
lacked
the
proper
mental
health
help
he
needed.
So
I
understood
using
weed
as
a
crutch.
I
knew
this
when
we
got
together
and
I
personally
never
had
an
issue
with
it
until
our
daughter
was
born.When
we
found
out
I
was
pregnant,
he
aured
me
that
he
was
going
to
make
an
effort
to
stop
smoking
and
get
the
mental
health
help
he
needs.
He
grew
up
with
parents
that
smoked
weed
all
of
the
time
and
he
always
said
he
didn’t
want
our
daughter
to
play
second
fiddle
to
any
kind
of
substance.
Once
she
was
born,
he
did
get
on
medication
to
help
his
mental
health
and
he
did
stop
smoking
completely
for
about
2
months.
But
he’s
recently
picked
it
back
up
again.
It’s
not
nearly
as
bad
as
it
was
before,
but
it’s
still
a
weekly
(if
not
every
other
day)
occurrence.
It’s
gotten
to
the
point
where
he
has
lied
to
me
about
purchasing
marijuana
and
has
gone
behind
my
back
and
smoked
it
once
I
fell
asleep.
He
says
he
should
be
able
to
pick
it
up
and
put
it
down
whenever
he
pleases.
I
told
him
I
was
okay
with
him
smoking
it
during
the
weekend
with
friends
if
he
wanted
to,
but
it’s
turning
into
more
than
that
now.
So
now
because
of
his
behavior
towards
it,
I
personally
believe
that
he
should
stop
altogether
because
I
believe
that
he
has
a
very
serious
dependency
on
it
and
I
don’t
want
our
daughter
to
see
it
growing
up.
So,
AITA
for
wanting
him
to
stop
smoking
weed?

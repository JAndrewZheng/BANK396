I
(40F)
am
happily
married
and
have
two
small
children.
About
two
years
ago
my
ex
(we
will
call
him
“Ron”,
40M)
and
his
family
moved
across
the
street
from
my
parents
house.
A
little
background…
this
was
my
high
school
bf,
20
years
ago
(for
about
a
year)
and
literally
the
worst
person
I
ever
dated.
A
total
jerk,
cheated
constantly,
put
me
down,
strung
me
along
and
was
exceptionally
cruel.
I
was
young
and
didn’t
know
any
better.
I
have
not
interacted
with
him
in
20
years
and
was
hoping
that
I
would
never
cross
paths
with
him
again.
My
parents
have
lived
in
the
same
house
for
35
years
so
he
absolutely
knew
they
lived
there
when
he
purchased
the
house
across
the
street.
Their
neighborhood
has
a
lot
of
young
kids
and
there
are
a
lot
of
block
parties,
birthday
parties,
and
group
activities
that
the
entire
street
participates
in.
My
children
visit
their
grandparents
maybe
once
a
month.
My
parents
are
aware
of
the
history
between
Ron
and
I.
I
made
it
abundantly
clear
to
my
mom
that
my
kids
were
absolutely
not
allowed
to
play
with
his
kids.
About
a
month
ago
my
mom
told
me
that
she
was
outside
with
my
daughter,
playing
with
another
neighbor
kid,
and
Ron’s
kids
were
staring
at
them
from
across
the
street.
My
mom
let
them
all
play
together
outside
for
15
minutes
because
she
“felt
bad
for
them”.
I
was
not
happy.
My
mom
cried
when
I
got
upset
about
this.
She
has
a
history
of
not
respecting
my
boundaries
and
I
keep
her
at
a
distance.
Occasionally
my
children
are
invited
to
the
birthday
parties
of
other
neighborhood
kids.
I
grew
up
with
the
parents
of
these
kids.
Since
moving
across
the
street,
Ron
and
his
family
are
now
invited
and
attend
all
the
kids
parties
and
events.
It’s
annoying
but
it
is
their
neighborhood
now
too.
I
live
in
my
own
house
a
few
miles
away.
I
have
had
my
mom
take
my
kids
to
the
birthday
parties
but
I
am
not
thrilled
with
my
children
socializing
with
Ron’s
kids.
I
realize
this
is
definitely
not
the
kids
beef
but
I
want
nothing
to
do
with
his
children
or
family.
Like
zero
interaction.
And
I
feel
weird
sending
my
kids
to
parties
that
I
wouldn’t
be
comfortable
attending.
Today
I
told
my
mom
no
more
parties
where
Ron
and
his
kids
will
be
attending.
My
children
have
lots
of
friends
and
we
don’t
need
to
be
in
the
same
social
circle
as
Ron
and
his
offspring.
I
had
several
serious
relationships
after
Ron
and
before
I
met
my
husband.
I
would
have
no
problem
with
my
kids
playing
with
any
of
my
other
ex’s
kids.
I
hadn’t
thought
about
Ron
in
years
and
then
he
moved
across
the
street
from
my
parents
and
is
right
in
my
face.
So
my
question
is….
AM
I
THE
ASSHOLE
for
not
wanting
my
kids
around
his?

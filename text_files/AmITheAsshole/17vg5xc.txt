She is a very picky eater and pretty much only
eats like 5 things McDonald's, chicken strips , mac and
cheese  and frozen pizza. So we are with some
of my friends and his girlfriend spent all day cooking
us an amazing meal. As we are all sitting there
eating she has an untouched plate and my friends spous
asks her if everything is ok she says yes im
just a very picky eater and she then offered to
cook her something else.  when my girlfriend got up
from the table to go to the kitchen with her,
i pulled her to the side and asked her why
she would do that, and it was best if you
just go. one other time with just the 2 of
us at a nice restaurant the same thing happened 
it has been a maive fight every time. She insists
that people are fine with it but I just find
it embarraing and incredibly rude.

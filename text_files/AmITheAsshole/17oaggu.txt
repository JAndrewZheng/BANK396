My 29F fiancé 28M loves to party. Spending a Friday,
Saturday, or Sunday not getting drunk is not an option
for him. In general this has started to annoy me
the older we’ve gotten, but lately I’ve been more and
more concerned with his behavior.I’m a nurse and on weekends
I can’t go out my fiancé will stay out all
night drinking, despite me asking him to be home by
midnight or 2am those nights so I don’t need to
be disrupted before working 12h. Right now, it’s 5am, and
he isn’t home and hasn’t responded to my last two
texts asking when he’d be home. He’s told me in
the past he will never stop drinking, but lately I’ve
been wanting him to cut back on drinking because he
also has a sports gambling addiction that is worse when
he’s drunk. This week he had to withdraw from his
401k for the 4th time to fund sports gambling losses.
For that reason I’ve wanted him to cut back on
the partying but lo and behold he hasn’t.We’ve been getting
into more and more arguments regarding his partying and gambling
but he will make me feel like an asshole for
making him feel bad about gambling because 1- I have
a lot of student loan debt (he thinks these two
things are comparable) and 2- he claims he has to
spend all day while I’m working on the weekends alone
so I shouldn’t be bothered by his weekend night partying.
AITA?

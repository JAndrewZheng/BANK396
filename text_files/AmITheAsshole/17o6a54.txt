So me (21f) and my bf (25m) have been dating
for almost 2 years and I love him very much.
We’re getting to the point now of talking about marriage
and things like that, but we both still live at
home because I just finished college and he had a
failed roommate experience a couple months ago. I asked him
where we would live if we hypothetically got married, and
he said we could live with his parents for a
while. I said no because I know his parents would
hate that and I would hate that too. I like
his parents but I don’t think that would work very
well, especially if we wanna make our own family some
day. He told me he never wants to leave the
house he grew up in, but especially his mom. They
have a very co dependent relationship I think, I feel
like he wouldn’t be happy anywhere if his mom isn’t
there. He got mad at me and called me rude
because I didn’t wanna move into his parents house. I
thought I wasn’t overreacting but he’s still mad at me.
Am I the asshole? Tl;Dr bf wants me to move
in with him and his parents if we ever get
married

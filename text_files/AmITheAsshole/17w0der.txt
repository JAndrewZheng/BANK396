I (37m) and my wife Jane (28f) have been together
for 5 years and married for 2. Our relationship was
always good but it’s taken a downturn recently. When we
got together we had the same job, made similar amounts
of money and attended a lot of social events both
separately and together. A year ago, Jane won a life
changing amount of money (in the millions) and quit her
job to set up some charities that help our local
community. She’s always been active in our community. She donates
books to the library, volunteers for book groups, goes to
community council etc. but ever since setting up her charities
she spends a lot of time away from home and
at events. She always invites me but I rarely go
as they’re long and boring and frankly the amount of
them she goes to is exhausting. She’s now so well
known in the community we can’t go out without someone
talking to her on the street or recognising her. I
feel like I’m in a relationship with her voicemail sometimes.
I decided to confront her about it and we had
a maive argument, during which she said she enjoys talking
to people in our community and hearing how she helped
them. I told her she’s selfish, and throwing money at
a small a town doesn’t make her famous. She said
she wasn’t trying to be, and that I know how
much the community and helping people means to her and
why, that I had gone too far. She’s now staying
with her aunt and won’t talk to me. AITA?

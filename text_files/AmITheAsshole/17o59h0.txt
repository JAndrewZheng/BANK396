Two years ago I (36M) was caught up in a
bullying incident at work and had to go off work
from trauma and a mental breakdown. I ended up going
through Workers Compensation Board. The process took forever. Over 6
months to get a partial approval and over a year
for them to find me the victim of Hate Speech
in the workplace. During the investigation stage, there was very
little income for my husband (35M) and I. Within 6
months I had eaten through my savings and maxed my
cards. I had to turn to my parents for financial
aid. I borrowed just over $3k from my father (65M)
during that period. My mother (62F) went to pieces over
my situation and began to blame me for it. She
told me that I should not ‘take advantage of the
system’ that I should go back and beg for my
job back. Or find another job. To not get legal
advice or go through taking my work to the WCB.
My sister (42F) began telling me to know when to
call it quits and that I was tearing the family
apart. My sister and mother would talk about me and
what I should do without me present. They even hatched
the idea that we should kick out our renter (who
happens to be my husband’s grandmother) and start an AirBnB.
When I said it was a horrible idea, my sister
made a comment that she’s just some old lady and
would be better in a home. My husband stuck up
for his grandmother and my sister mocked my husband for
doing so. After sticking up for my husband and demanding
my sister apologize, I was demonized and my mother even
started accusing my husband of nefarious intentions on me. I
ended up, after more drama, cutting my sister out. My
mother and father blame me and insist that I apologize
and make it work. I believe I’m owed the apology
and refuse to take unnecessary blame to save the peace.
Am I The Asshole ripping their family apart, or am
I just sticking up for myself?

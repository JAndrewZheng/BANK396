Our
across
the
street
neighbors
do
not
pull
into
their
driveway
nose
first.
They
do
something
like
a
3
point
turn
in
the
street,
nearly
driving
into
our
lawn
so
they
can
back
into
their
driveway.
When
anyone
parks
in
front
of
our
house,
they
complain,
leave
notes
on
the
car
(parked
in
front
of
our
house),
or
blow
the
horn
on
their
car
to
make
sure
we
know
they
are
unhappy.
They
have
suggested
if
they
hit
a
parked
car,
they
would
not
be
responsible
because
we
are
'blocking
their
driveway'.
To
be
clear,
there
is
not
a
car
parked
in
front
of
their
driveway
entrance,
it
is
parked
across
the
street
from
their
driveway
entrance.
It
is
also
a
rather
wide
street.
Regardless
of
what
car
I
am
driving,
I
can
back
into
a
driveway
without
the
need
for
a
multi-point
turn.
Their
driveway
is
not
narrow;
they
could
easily
turn
a
car
around
in
their
driveway,
too,
if
they
wanted
to.
So,
are
we
AH
because
we
occasionally
park
a
car
in
front
of
our
house
on
a
public
road?

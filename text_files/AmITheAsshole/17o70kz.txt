My (30M) brother (22M) is spending a semester in Asia
and I offered to pay for his flight so he
can attend our mother’s (57F) wedding. I got the cheapest
flight available - it’s not like I have money to
spare -, which includes a 9 hour layover during the
night. As soon as he got the email confirmation with
the tickets he asked if there wasn’t a more direct
flight, which bothered me already. Then he asked me I
could lend him some money so he can spend the
night at a capsule hotel at the airport. He says
otherwise he will be exhausted at our mother’s wedding (which
takes place the same day he arrives). I told him
he can sleep on the airport bench for all I
care, and I’m doing too much already. Even if he
eventually pays me back (I doubt it), I couldn’t believe
how ungrateful he was being. AITA here?

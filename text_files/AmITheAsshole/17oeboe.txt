So I (28m) have a friend “Andrew” (26m) who I’ve
known since high school. We both grew up in similar
circumstances but I have always held a full time job
and got my degree, while Andrew has struggled to hold
down jobs and control his substance use (weed and alcohol,
not street drugs).A couple years ago my bf (now husband)
and I rented an apartment with Andrew. Andrew never kept
his stuff clean, ate our food and drank our liquor,
and was constantly late on rent.  At the end
of the lease, Andrew came to me asking for money.
He offered his bike and a few peices of furniture
for several hundred dollars. He said he needed the money
for first months rent and wouldn’t have any room for
the bike/furniture anyway. I reluctantly agreed.A year or two go
by, I’m still working full time, he’s unemployed and struggling
with his mental health. We talk a lot less but
I still try to be supportive how I can, encourage
good habits, be a decent example of a functional human,
etc. Then he asks for the bike back. At first
he says he is gonna get me another bike to
replace it. To me this already felt shady - why
not get yourself the new bike and I keep the
one I paid you for?  (According to him, it’s
sentimental). Then he sends a picture of the POS bike
he wants to trade. No thanks - I’ll keep the
one I have. Then he wants to trade something else
instead, then he will “get me a bike in the
future”, each time he had a new idea to get
the bike back. For months I couldn’t have a conversation
with him without him bringing it up. He would guilt
me with… “if I had a bike I could go
outside and I  wouldn’t be depressed.” “If I had
a bike I could go find a job” etc.Am I
the asshole for not giving him his bike back?

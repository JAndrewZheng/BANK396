My
(29f)
sister
(26f)
is
getting
married
in
a
few
weeks
and
she
sent
me
a
invitation.
She
wants
a
child
free
wedding
and
since
I
have
no
one
to
watch
my
baby
I
wouldn’t
be
able
to
go
so
I
asked
her
if
she
could
make
an
exception
so
I
could
go.
I
didn’t
push
her
to
let
or
anything
I
simply
asked
and
she
went
off
on
me.
She
called
me
an
ahole
for
rejecting
her
invite
and
making
my
whole
life
revolved
around
my
son.
I
told
her
I
had
no
one
to
watch
my
son
so
I
wouldn’t
be
able
to
go
but
it’s
also
fine
that
she
doesn’t
want
to
make
an
exception.
She
suggested
that
I
asked
neighbors
to
watch
him
but
I
didn’t
really
like
that
idea
because
I’m
new
to
the
neighborhood
and
don’t
really
know
anybody.
I
told
her
that
and
she
blew
up
at
me
and
said
I’m
supposed
to
support
her
on
her
day,
AITA
here?

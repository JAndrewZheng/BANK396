Thanksgiving
special;
My
wife
worked
very
hard
to
make
a
Thanksgiving
dinner
for
my
in
laws
who
flew
in
to
stay
with
us.
We
stayed
up
late
and
woke
up
early.
The
food
was
phenomenal,
and
easily
the
BEST
Thanksgiving
spread
I
have
ever
had.
It's
the
first
year
she
had
full
control
of
the
menu,
at
our
house.Her
sister
was
supposed
to
come
over
to
help
during
the
day,
but
ended
up
going
with
her
fiance
to
his
family's
house.
No
hard
feelings,
I
have
pulled
my
wife
away
from
her
family
in
the
past
and
I
understand.As
we
sat
down
to
eat
around
6
pm,
make
our
plates,
and
say
grace,
her
sister
shows
up.
She
sits
down
at
the
table
with
a
maive
1.5
gallon
Tupperware
container.
She
keeps
asking
if
everyone
has
gotten
their
food.
Once
everyone
gets
their
first
plate,
she
fills
this
fer
up
with
our
food,
and
says
that
her
fiance
is
waiting
in
the
car
and
wants
to
go
home.
So
she
leaves.This
upsets
my
wife,
who
now
two
days
later
has
still
not
had
any
of
the
food
that
worked
so
hard
on.
It's
all
in
the
fridge.So
the
next
day,
we
go
out
to
eat.
Mother
in
law
gets
some
soup
(menudo)
to
go.
We
go
to
a
Christmas
tree
farm
with
my
kids
about
an
hour
from
the
city.
On
the
way
back,
with
a
tree
strapped
to
the
top,
mother
in
law
asks
me
to
drive
an
additional
40
minutes
out
of
my
way
to
drop
the
soup,
which
at
this
point
is
5
hours
old,
for
my
wife's
sister.I
said
absolutely
not,
and
dropped
them
off
at
the
hotel.For
context,
our
neighbor
slipped
us
a
Thanksgiving
card
right
before
we
ate,
so
my
wife
was
overjoyed
to
make
him
a
plate
with
a
little
bit
of
everything,
including
desert.
It
made
her
so
happy
to
share
what
she
made,
but
at
least
he
sent
a
card..
so
she
isn't
selfish.
What
her
sister
did
made
her
feel
used.

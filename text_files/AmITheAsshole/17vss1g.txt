First of all i do understand how bad my title
makes it sound but just listen. My friend 14 and
me also 14 we are in school and these past
two years were I have been close to her she
has been struggling with mental health issues . She started
by venting to me she vented to me every night
over text for almost an hour while I had to
comfort her and she also vented anytime we hung out
in person or at school all she talks about are
her problems. She also just got diagnosed with anxiety and
after being diagnosed she keeps having panic attacks which are
fine I’m not judging but when she is having two
a day which take Atleast if not more than half
an hour to comfort her and help calm her down
it’s so annoying and I have other things to do
. She also self diagnosed herself with adhd and autism
and goes around saying she has them she also cries
to me Atleast once a day . All these things
combined makes being friends with her very draining and hard
as she only talks about herself and her issues when
she knows I deal with my Own crap so am
I the ahole

I’m
38,
my
wife
is
33,
and
her
daughter
(my
stepdaughter)
is
11.
I’ve
been
married
to
my
wife
for
3
years
now,
together
for
4.
I
met
her
daughter
when
she
was
7
and
married
my
wife
when
she
was
8.(This
is
getting
confusing,
so
my
daughter
can
be
“Millie”.)
My
wife
got
divorced
when
Millie
was
6,
her
ex
cheated.
But
they
still
have
a
decent
cordial
relationship
and
my
wife
doesn’t
badmouth
Millie’s
bio
dad
in
front
of
Millie.
My
wife
has
mostly
full
custody
but
her
bio
dad
gets
Millie
one
weekend
a
month.
Millie
loves
her
bio
dad,
but
they
are
not
very
close
anymore.
She
doesn’t
remember
a
lot
of
when
her
dad
lived
with
her,
and
she
doesn’t
see
him
often,
so
it’s
more
of
a
formal
relationship.
He
gets
her
ice
cream
and
they
watch
movies
and
basically
she
has
a
lot
of
fun
when
she
sees
him,
but
I’m
the
dad
who
comforts
her
when
she
has
nightmares
and
listens
to
her
chatter
every
day
about
the
stuff
that
happened
in
school.
I
love
her
very
much
and
think
of
her
as
my
daughter.
Until
recently
though
she
was
still
calling
me
by
first
name.
I
didn’t
mind,
but
a
few
weeks
ago
she
told
me
her
friends
said
it
was
weird
that
she
doesn’t
call
her
dad
“dad”.
Then
she
had
to
explain
that
I’m
not
actually
her
dad
and
it
was
awkward.
I
sympathized
and
said
that
sucks,
then
I
told
her
that
if
she
wants,
she
can
of
course
call
me
dad.
I
didn’t
think
about
this
very
much,
it
just
seemed
obvious.
But
she
was
very
happy
and
now
she
only
calls
me
daddy.
My
wife’s
ex
came
over
for
thanksgiving
because
my
wife
wanted
Millie
to
have
both
her
parents
there
for
once.
I
wasn’t
super
happy
but
I
was
okay
with
it.
Her
ex
heard
Millie
calling
me
dad
and
questioned
Millie
in
an
upset
way,
and
she
said
that
I
told
her
that
me
and
him
are
both
her
dads.
He
got
really
angry
and
started
screaming
at
me,
saying
that
I’m
not
her
dad
and
she
should
know
that.
Later
my
wife
was
upset
with
me,
saying
I
should
have
thought
about
how
Millie’s
relationship
with
her
“real”
dad
would
suffer
before
I
told
Millie
something
like
this.
She
says
I’m
selfish
and
just
want
to
feel
like
her
real
dad,
and
even
if
Millie
doesn’t
call
me
dad
it’s
not
a
big
deal.
AITA?

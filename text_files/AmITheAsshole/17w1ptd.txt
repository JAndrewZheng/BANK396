So I am a leader within retail. I like to
think I’m pretty understanding and care a lot about my
employees but I’m starting to go insane. I have a
few select employees who will say they’re going to work
a shift when I ask them call a different manager
and say they said they can’t work (luckily I document
EVERYTHING) or I’ll ask them if they want the day
off ( for payroll reasons) they say yes then tell
the other leaders that they need more hours. I’ve had
ENOUGH. I told the other managers not accommodate them anymore
in anyway when it comes to scheduling unless it’s 2
weeks or more out. Am I in the wrong for
cutting it all off regardless of the reason?

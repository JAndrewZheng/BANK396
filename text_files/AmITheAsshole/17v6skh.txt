TL;DR- Purchaser of my car modified the title and now
wants my help to correct his mistake.Last month I sold
my car to a younger guy. Long story short, he
admitted he'd never bought a car from someone and it
showed.He was incredibly naive and unsure of how anything worked
when selling/buying a car. Questions to ask, process of transferring
a title, etc.Anyway, back when I sold the car, we
met up at the notary to get the title transferred.
Before we went in, I said "hey, if you're cool
with it, we can just write $1000 for the sale
price of the car, it'll save you some taxes." (I
sold him the car for $2800)At first he agreed, but
I could tell he was uncomfortable or nervous. Inside, after
waiting for a few minutes for our turn, he leans
over and says, nervously, "Hey man, I don't wanna do
anything wrong, I want everything to be done right, I'll
just write the full price on the title."Whatever, I was
just trying to do you a favor. Yesterday, he blows
up my phone with like 4 text messages asking me
if I'll meet him to sign some paperwork.Apparently they refused
to grant him license plates because, and I quote, "of
a small scribble."I asked him, "What, did you scribble out
the purchase price??" And he said, "something like that, lol"So
now this idiot wants me to drive an hour one-way
to meet him to sign a purchase price affidavit because
he can't get license plates because he didn't want to
listen to me. This is very inconvenient. My wife and
I have pretty much every weekend booked now until the
end of the year because we're expecting our first child
in early January. What would you do? Would I be
the ahole if I tell him to pound salt?EDIT 1:
To clarify, when the title was originally notarized, he (buyer)
wrote in $2800 as sale price in front of the
notary. After the fact, he then scribbled out and tried
to change the sale price to something else.

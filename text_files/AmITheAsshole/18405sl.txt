So
I
planned
a
trip
in
Latin
America
over
Thanksgiving
with
my
mom,
my
boyfriend,
bf’s
sister,
a
mutual
friend
(called
A
for
this
post)
who
is
closer
friends
with
my
boyfriend,
and
A’s
friend
(called
P)
who
we
never
met
before.A
few
days
into
the
trip,
it
almost
turns
into
a
guy’s
trip
between
my
boyfriend,
A,
and
P.
Yesterday,
we
did
a
sunrise
hike
and
ate
lunch.
After
that
they
branched
off
and
did
their
own
thing
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night.
Last
night,
they
sat
at
basically
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
at
dinner
(our
house
dining
room
table
is
really
long).
It
was
a
casual
meal
but
still.
The
next
day
they
planned
a
proper
“guys
day”
for
12+
hours
and
planned
a
really
cool
ATV
tour
for
some
of
it
but
extended
no
invite
to
any
of
the
women.
They
only
invited
us
to
meet
them
for
dinner
because
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
get
transportation
back
to
our
village
if
they
had
dinner
where
the
ATV
tour
ended,
which
they
wanted
to
do.
In
the
evenings,
they’ll
make
a
fire
and
smoke
cigars
and
exclude
themselves.
My
boyfriend
will
try
to
loop
me
in
a
bit
but
it’s
clear
I’d
be
that
girlfriend
inserting
herself
in
guy
time.
So,
I’m
completely
all
for
some
friend/guy
or
girl
time.
I
also
agree
that
not
everyone
has
to
do
EVERYTHING
together
on
a
trip,
but
right
now
their
actions
feel
a
bit
rude
and
excessive.
I
want
my
boyfriend
to
have
quality
time
with
his
friend,
A,
as
he
doesn’t
see
him
often,
and
don’t
want
to
get
in
the
way
of
that.
But
I
also
know
A
well
and
don’t
think
that
multiple
days
of
“guy
time”
is
necessarily
polite
with
a
larger
group.
It
seems
like
they
would
be
happier
if

this
was
a
guy’s
only
trip.
“A”
came
on
our
Thanksgiving
trip
last
year
and
this
wasn’t
an
issue.
I
haven’t
mentioned
my
annoyance
to
my
boyfriend
yet
but
am
I
the
a-hole
here?
I
want
to
book
the
ATV
tour
tomorrow
for
the
rest
of
us
out
of
spite
😂AITA
for
being
mad
the
guys
are
planning
so
much
for
just
themselves
on
this
trip
and
not
inviting
the
rest
of
us?

I 24f, have a freind Mia (fake name for privacy)
26f, that's getting married this December. recently me, Mia, and
the other bridesmaids Ashley, and Sam where going over the
wedding rules, and she said that white wasn't aloud. I
was fine with this but then she looked at me
and said so of course you will be dying your
hair a different color. I was shocked, and said that
I didn't want to die my hair, considering that it
took me 9 months to get to this color, and
I didn't want to do that again, for a hair
color I'll keep for 1 week. she said that my
hair would bring to much attention to me, I said
that if it was that big of a deal than
I could wear a wig. she said that if I
wouldn't die my hair than I shouldn't even come to
the wedding. after she said that I left and went
home, but when I told my husband about it he
said I was wrong, and that it's just hair. so
reddit AITA.

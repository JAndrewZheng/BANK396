My
(freshly
18f)
father
(38m)
went
to
California
for
thanksgiving
this
year
with
his
wife
(my
second
step
mom),
their
7-month
old,
and
my
brother

(7m
from
my
first
step
mom).
I
live
with
my
grandma
(dad's
mom)
and
we
found
out
about
five
days
before
the
trip.
We
were
not
extended
an
invitation.
Apparently,
they
went
to
San
Francisco
and
did
a
bunch
of
touristy
things
I
would
have
also
enjoyed
doing.
I
found
out
from
my
step-mom's
insta
with
captions
"Fun
Family
Trip!"
and
"San
Fran
with
the
whole
fam!"They
came
home
yesterday,
and
my
grandma
has
decided
we're
going
to
their
house
to
catch
up
for
a
bit.
I
know
it's
nosy,
and
I
know
it
could
cause
drama,
but
I
want
to
ask
why
my
grandma
and
I
were
not
invited.
For
a
minute,
I
thought
perhaps
it
was
because
of
costs,
but
she
comes
from
a
well-off
family,
and
I've
seen
firsthand
that
they
never
worry
about
money
or
costs.
I'm
feeling
very
hurt
that
they
took
my
siblings
but
didn't
think
to
invite
me.
It
might
be
because
I'm
18
now,
but
I
only
just
turned
18
two
weeks
ago.
I'm
still
in
high
school,
and
I
find
that
very
odd
that
that
could
be
the
reason.
Should
I
ask?
Or
should
I
leave
well
enough
alone?

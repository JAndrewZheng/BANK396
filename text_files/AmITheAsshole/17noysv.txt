Let me start this off by saying, I don't wear
certain make up brands because I don't like their business
practices. The brands that I agree with and like the
product are high end/luxury. My daughter (13 F) started asking
to get make up. I took her to few make
up conters so we could see what worked. I waited
a few days to see if she had any reactions
or issues with any brands/products. We bought some products. I
reminded her to bring things like her eyeliner and lipstick
with her for retouches. She has been reapplying those things.
One girl, in her grade, asked her if her lipstick
was real or fake. She told me about this and
I told her to ignore it. Now everyone calls her
by the brand name or brandname lipstick. When I discussed
this with her teacher, and I understand teachers have it
hard, she claimed my daughter pulls it out often and
was showing. AITA for buying her expensive lipstick? I wanted
to do a nice thing and now she's crying

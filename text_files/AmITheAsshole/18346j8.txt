My
(32F)
sister
(36F)
already
has
6
kids
with
her
husband
(40M),
which
is
way
more
than
they
can
comfortably
provide
for
given
what
I
know
about
their
financial
troubles,
and
also
way
more
than
both
of
them
can
handle,
since
it
came
to
a
point
where
my
older
niece
(15F)
is
treated
as
an
unpaid
babysitter
by
her
parents
and
constantly
expected
to
help
with
her
younger
siblings.My
sister
recently
went
through
a
miscarriage
on
her
seventh
pregnancy,
and
I
understand
this
can
be
a
painful
experience,
but
as
I
was
talking
about
this
with
her,
I
told
her
at
least
she
has
other
6
children
in
her
life
already
and
that
maybe
that’s
enough.
She
got
very
offended
by
my
comment
and
told
me
I
was
being
very
insensitive
and
that
her
family
choices
have
nothing
to
do
with
me.
(Actually
it
has
because
I
had
to
loan
her
and
her
husband
money
in
more
than
one
occasion
so
they
could
support
the
household,
but
I
didn’t
tell
her
that
as
to
not
make
things
worse).Anyway,
am
I
really
the
AH
here?Edit:
to
be
clear,
my
sister
wasn't
7
months
along
when
she
had
the
miscarriage.
She
was
in
the
early
stages
of
her
seventh
pregnancy.
It's
something
many
people
seem
to
have
misinterpreted
from
my
post.

I
(F16)
have
a
parrot.
Before
I
was
born,
lightning
struck
inside
of
the
house
near
the
parrot,
and
since
then
whenever
he
sees
something
that
flickers
or
resembles
lightning,
he
starts
screaming
until
it
goes
away.
We
took
him
to
a
vet
once
to
see
why
he
does
this,
and
it
is
because
he
is
traumatized.Me
and
my
mom
just
recently
moved
into
a
house,
and
the
light
in
the
entryway
has
a
setting
that
flickers
rapidly.
She
really
likes
it
and
refuses
to
turn
it
off
for
any
reason.
Yesterday,
she
took
the
parrot
out
of
his
cage
and
put
him
near
the
entryway,
and
he
started
screaming
because
of
the
flickering
light.
I
told
her
to
turn
off
the
light
because
it
was
most
likely
giving
him
flashbacks.
She
told
me
that
he
just
needed
to
deal
with
it
because
that
was
the
way
the
house
was.
When
she
left,
I
turned
off
the
light,
and
he
instantly
stopped
screaming.
She
came
back
and
turned
it
on,
and
he
started
screaming
again.Last
night,
I
decided
to
unscrew
the
lightbulb
to
the
light
because
I
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
change
the
setting
to
where
it
doesn't
flicker.
I
really
felt
bad
for
our
parrot
because
my
mom
had
told
him
to
deal
with
what
gave
him
flashbacks.
This
morning
she
tried
to
turn
it
on,
and
she
wondered
where
the
lightbulbs
went.
I
told
her
I
unscrewed
them
because
she
didn't
listen
to
me
when
I
told
her
about
how
it
was
upsetting
our
parrot.
She
yelled
at
me
and
said
that
I
shouldn't
mess
with
the
electrical
work
ever
again
and
that
she
knows
what's
best
for
our
parrot.
The
conversation
ended
there,
however
she
is
not
talking
to
me
and
refuses
to
let
me
see
the
parrot
(he's
currently
in
another
room.
Anytime
I
go
there
she
tells
me
to
not
go
in.)
I
haven't
told
anyone
else
about
this
yet,
but
I
am
planning
to
tell
my
dad
depending
on
whether
I
was
in
the
wrong
or
not.

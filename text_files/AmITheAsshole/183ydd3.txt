So
as
the
title
suggests,
am
I
the
ahole
for
this.
Me
and
my
bf
live
in
a
a
decent
sized
detached
house
and
work
different
shifts.
Tonight
he
was
laid
in
bed
and
I
was
taking
my
makeup
off
in
the
bathroom
across
the
hall
and
cleaning
my
teeth
with
my
electric
toothbrush.
I
mention
this
cause
running
the
tap
and
having
the
electric
toothbrush
in
my
mouth
means
I
can't
hear
him
very
well
when
he's
talking
at
a
normal
volume
in
the
bedroom.Worth
mentioning
we've
both
got
a
bit
crap
hearing
too
from
years
of
working
in
entertainment.
We
both
have
routing
hearing
tests
and
don't
need
hearing
aids
or
anything
before
anyone
mentions
this-
it's
more
about
distance
in
the
house.He
will
often
be
laying
on
the
sofa
with
the
tv
on
full
blast
and
try
and
tell
me
something
that
happened
to
work,
or
something
interesting.
Problem
is
I'm
cooking
his
tea
or
washing
clothes
and
there
are
two
doors
and
two
walls
in
the
the
way,
I
have
a
cooker
fan
and
an
extractor
on
and
probably
a
washing
machine
too.
He
gets
cranky
if
I
can't
hear
him
but
I
can't
stop
doing
what
I
am
doing,
drop
everything
and
go
to
him.Also
worth
mentioning
he
had
persistent
back
pain
from
years
of
doing
a
manual
job
and
he's
laying
down
he
won't
get
up
as
it
makes
his
back
hurt.I
have
asked
him
a
few
times
to
come
and
talk
to
me
wherever
I
am
doing
whatever
tasks
or
hobbies
etc
I
am
to
talk
to
me
but
he
likes
to
stay
put
and
I
should
come
to
him
(or
hurry
up
as
he
puts
it
-
which
annoys
me
as
every
night
I
have
to
rush
to
do
my
skincare
and
sort
my
hair
out)
I
feel
he's
being
selfish
and
acting
needy.
I
really
have
grown
to
dislike
the
trait
in
him
and
I
actually
get
angry
as
soon
as
he
starts
a
conversation
from
another
room
these
days.
We're
both
40's
no
kids.
Been
together
10+
years.Tonight
I
lost
it
at
him
and
raised
my
voice.
Now
we're
not
talking
at
all
which
is
a
shame
as
we
are
actually
in
the
same
room.
I
don't
see
why
he
can't
wait
for
me
to
finish
whatever
I
am
doing
in
a
totally
separate
part
of
the
house
and
come
see
him.
Am
I
the
ahole.
I
just
wish
he
would
be
more
patient
with
me.

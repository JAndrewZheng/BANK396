I (18f) overheard conversations with my mom and my dad
(39f and 40m) about how they planned to kick me
out shortly after my eighteenth birthday. The way they were
talking about it seemed like they were unalived serious and
the way it was brought up multiple times made it
seem like they were going to kick me out too.So,
I decided that I wouldn't give them the chance to
kick me out and made plans with my friend "Riley"
(17f) to stay at her place until I graduated and
moved into a college dorm or had an apartment of
my own. Riley's parents were horrified by at the thought
my parents would kick me out the second I turned
eighteen and agreed to let me stay at their place
as long as I graduated high school.Riley, her parents, and
my boyfriend "Cole" (18m) came after midnight to help me
take my belongings to their car and drive me to
Riley's house. My parents woke up in the middle of
this, and asked me what the hell was going. I
kinda shrugged and told them that I was moving out
before they could kick me out. My parents tried to
deny this, and attempted to stop me from leaving but
there was nothing that they could do since I'm a
legal adult. ( By the way, I wasn't just going
to leave in the middle of the night without any
goodbye,  I already put a note on the kitchen
table where my mom goes to first in the morning,
explaining what happened.) Right now, I'm at Riley's house in
their spare bedroom, and I've gotten bombarded with calls from
my parents asking me to come back and not to
tell my grandparents about this.In one text, my mom called
me an ungrateful bitch for leaving in the middle of
the night, and that she should've kicked me out sooner.

So
me
(21f)
live
with
3
other
roommates
(all
female
25+)
has
had
countless
conversations
about
hygiene
and
keeping
the
place
clean
but
this
is
the
last
straw.So
we
have
a
pretty
old
drainage
system
which
means
after
someone
showers
they
have
to
remove
their
hair
from
the
shower
drain
and
dump
it
so
it
won’t
get
blocked.
I’ve
literally
sent
countless
messages
into
the
gc
about
this
(like
remove
the
hair
after
you
shower
simple
)
and
done
my
fair
share
of
cleaning
out
the
manky
drain.
I’ve
finally
had
enough
when
I
found
loads
of
pubes
on
the
shower
floor,
I
told
them
to
clean
that
away
and
remove
the
hair
out
of
the
drain
when
done.They
managed
to“
washed
the
pubes
away
“
but
did
not
remove
them
from
the
drain,
so
after
that
I
gave
up
,
haven’t
removed
any
hair
since
(
3
weeks
ago
)
fast
forward
to
today.My
roommate1
had
a
long
shower
which
resulted
in
the
water
literally
pouring
out
as
far
as
the
door
to
my
room
and
kitchen
(
it’s
a
small
apartment)
She
attempted
to
take
out
some
the
hair
from
the
drain
but
found
it
too
disgusting
and
decided
to
dump
all
the
hair
(and
lumpy
unalived
skin
cells
because
they
like
to
scrub
themselves)
on
the
floor
and
just
left
.
Roommate
2
(
girl
she
shares
room
with
)
came
out
to
look
and
saw
the
disgusting
fing
mess
but
R2
told
her
there’s
nothing
she
can
do
it’s
too
gross
so
they
went
back
into
their
room.
Leaving
the
muck
and
water
all
over
our
apartment
(This
has
happened
before
and
the
landlord

mentioned
that
if
any
of
the
water
were
to
leak
below
or
anything
,
he
will
terminate
our
contract
and
we
can
say
bye
bye
(
very
reasonable
)
)So
I’ve
been
down
with
a
bug
or
something
and
an
awful
fever
for
the
past
week.
like
my
head
is
spinning
and
I
feel
like
I’m
about
to
die.
Had
to
get
up
to
mop
the
floor
,
so
I
was
proper
PISSED
I
decided
to
mop
all
the
muck
and
BUNDLES
of
hair
right
to
her
door
along
with
some
mucky
water.
Also
banging
on
her
door
“accidentally
“
with
my
mop.
I
do
feel
kinda
guilty
but
it
felt
good
in
the
moment,
and
there’s
gonna
be
hell
tomorrow
morning
And
for
pp
who’s
gonna
ask
why
don’t
I
move,
this
is
an
apartment
in
Dublin
City
center
for
a
very
reasonable
price
(
if
you
know
you
know
)
and
landlord
is
nice
he
doesn’t
really
care
what
we
do
as
long
as
there’s
no
leaking
downstairs.

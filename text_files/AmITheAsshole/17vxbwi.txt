Hello, first post and just looking for some clarity. I
(F23) and my husband (m23) recently got married a few
months ago and got a house. His family lives overseas
but are planning to move here. One brother came before
we got married and I knew he was going to
live with us (m18) and it was fine, I agreed.
However, 6 weeks ago I found out his older brother
had booked a ticket to come live with us for
*what I thought* was a month a half. It turns
out it’s for 6 months. My husband said he wasn’t
aware at first but seemed shifty, and later acknowledged he
was aware he’d probably be around longer than a month
and a half. I can’t tell if he downplayed it
or I misunderstood. I have been upset and wanted for
us all to talk like adults about cars and bills
and schedules, plus about not being spoken too before the
ticket was booked. I spoke to them the other morning,
only for the older brother to just stand up and
leave after I spoke after ignoring me and staying on
his phone. I said his name so he knew I
was speaking to him. He walked out and eventually then
asked us for the ride to work! I kept it
light, spoke to him along side my husband so he
didn’t feel singled out and he flat out ignored me.
My husband has done nothing to solve this in six
weeks and I’m questioning this mess. Am I wrong to
be upset? His family says hospitality is important and more
family is more blessings, and I agree but I just
wish they’d respected me enough as the new bride to
ask how I felt living with a third male. Also
there is no guarantee he leaves in 6 months. AITA?

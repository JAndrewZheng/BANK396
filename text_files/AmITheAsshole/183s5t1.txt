My
son
Jeffrey
(M25)
has
had
maive
anger
issues
for
almost
his
entire
life.
It
started
when
he
was
14
or
so,
when
he
began
yelling
at
me
and
his
mother
frequently;
over
the
years,
this
continued,
resulting
in
Jeffrey
breaking
video
game
controllers,
getting
in
fights
at
school,
and
other
overt
displays
of
anger.
We
tried
talking
to
him,
grounding
him,
sending
him
to
therapists,
etc.
but
nothing
seemed
to
be
a
permanent
solution.
During
Jacob's
sophomore
year
of
college,
he
came
back
home
from
college
for
Thanksgiving
break
and
had
another
display
of
anger
that
was
essentially
a
36-hour
bender,
and
that's
when
me
and
my
wife
put
our
foot
down
and
told
Jacob
that
he
was
disinvited
from
Thanksgiving
and
that
we'd
be
pulling
him
out
of
school
to
get
him
some
help
full-time.
Once
his
semester
ended,
Jeffrey
didn't
come
back
home
and
we've
been
estranged
since.On
Thanksgiving,
everything
was
going
great
until
about
2:00,
when
Jeffrey
showed
up
unannounced
for
the
first
time
in
years.
He'd
managed
to
force
his
way
in
somehow
and
immediately
rambled
into
the
living
room
where
everyone
was
gathered.
He
then
began
angrily
ranting
about
how
we'd
ruined
his
life,
detailing
how
he'd
spent
the
last
five
years
in
unalived-end
jobs
and
was
unable
to
have
any
friendships
or
relationships,
and
that
he'd
make
us
pay
for
abandoning
him.
Jeffrey
noticeably
reeked
of
alcohol
when
he
came
in,
and
I
was
worried
for
his
safety.
Me
and
Jeffrey's
brother
Scott
stepped
in
and
tried
to
de-escalate
things,
telling
Jeffrey
he
was
still
loved
and
that
we'd
get
him
the
help
he
needs.
He
then
laughed
and
told
me
to
f
off,
stating
that
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
be
the
hero.
He
then
continued
ranting
for
a
few
more
minutes
before
I
called
911
to
have
him
removed,
and
a
few
minutes
after
that
the
police
came
and
dragged
him
kicking
and
screaming
out
of
the
house.
I
was
later
notified
that
they'd
arrested
him
for
DUI,
since
he
was
well
over
twice
the
legal
limit.
The
rest
of
the
family
told
me
that
I
did
the
right
thing
here,
but
I
can't
help
but
feel
a
little
guilty
about
how
things
played
out.

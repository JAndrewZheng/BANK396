Throwaway
for
keeping
my/my
family's
anonymity.The
title
narrows
the
problem
in
his
core,
but
for
better
understanding,
I
want
to
provide
some
information.As
I
was,
18(M)
the
marriage
of
my
parents
dissolved
due
to
my
mother's
disloyalty,
and
the
discovery,
that
my
half
sister(2yrs
old
at
the
time)
was
not
fathered
by
my
dad.
However,
we
lived
in
a
no-fault
divorces
state
at
the
time,
which
meant
that
my
father
was
dragged
to
the
jurisdictional
hell
of
family
court
and
loosing
his
livelihood.
My
mom
was
a
stay
at
home
wife
with
no
income
and
conveniently
enough
she
did
not
remember
my
half
sister's
biological
father,
so
to
add
insult
to
injury
my
father
was
ordered
to
pay
child
support
and
spousal
support
(for
whole
5
years).My
father
was
financially
devastated
after
months.
So
to
rebuild
his
life,
he
left
the
United
States,
back
to
Asia
where
my
grandparents
came
from
and
which
does
not
enforce
Child
support
or
spousal
support
obligation
ordered
by
US
courts.The
situation
had
now
changed,
because
the
fact
my
mom
had
no
job
sunalives,
she
could
not
continue
her
lavish
lifestyle
which
my
father
provided
in
the
marriage
and
after
the
divorce.
She
was
relying
on
social
benefits
and
had
to
work
in
low
income
retail-jobs.I
was
on
the
other
hand
cared
for
and
continue
my
trade
school,
living
with
my
uncle.
My
dad
kept
financially
supporting
me
while
dwindling
the
money
through
my
uncle.7
years
later
now,
I
have
my
own
place
where
I
live
(rental)
and
allow
currently
my
mother
and
half
sister
to
live
with
me,
because
she
fell
ill
to
covid
last
year
which
damaged
her
lungs
and
heart
permanently,
so
she
does
not
have
any
income
beside
social
benefits
anymore
and
can't
work,
she
is
bitter
and
miserable,
also
she
has
not
accepted
her
fault
and
blames
her
situation
to
everyone
else
but
her.
Of
course,
I
am
still
in
contact
with
my
father
and
visit
him
in
my
vacation,
he
remarried
a
Vietnamese
woman
4
years
ago,
and
they
have
a
baby
boy,
of
course
I
have
some
couple
of
pictures
which
I
have
hanged
around
my
house,
simply
due
to
the
fact
I
like
my
stepmom
and
my
baby
brother,
she
is
always
hospital
towards
me
and
my
baby
brother
is
just
the
cutest
baby
you
can
imagine.My
mom,
as
she
is,
is
not
only
insulting
her
but
also
my
father,
the
breaking
point
for
me
was
yesterday,
as
I
came
back
home
from
work
and
saw
all
the
pictures
on
MY
WALLS,
in
the
trash
bin.
We
had
a
Serious
Yelling
match
(for
a
lack
of
better
word),
where
I
have
told
her
she
will
land
on
the
street
if
she
ever
takes
any
bad
word
in
her
mouth
about
my
father,
and
the
only
reason
why
I
allowed
her
to
stay
is
not
she,
but
my
half
sister.
I
am
still
angry
about
her
behavior
and
tried
to
write
without
being
insulting,
I
think,
I
need
Opinion
from
outside

which
don't
have
a
clouded
judgment
like
I
do
at
the
moment
or
my
Family
members
I
am
still
in
contact.

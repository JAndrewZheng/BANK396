AITA
for
stopping
communication
with
my
MIL
because
of
her
lack
of
communication
with
her
grandkids
(my
kids)?I've
recently
decided
to
stopping
reaching
out
or
initiating
any
communication
with
my
MIL.
This
includes:
texting,
calling,
video
chatting,
and
visiting
her,
except
for
holiday
arrangements
that
is.
To
start
the
story:
a
couple
years
ago,
my
MIL
sat
me
and
my
husband
down
to
basically
yell
at
us
for
not
bringing
our
son,
who
was
less
then
a
year
old
then,
around
to
see
her
or
have
her
watch
him.
She
started
a
screaming
match
with
us
because
of
our
lack
of
including
her.Now,
two
years
later,
our
son
is
almost
3
and
our
daughter
is
10
months
old.
My
MIL
never
texts,
calls,
or
video
chats
her
son
or
grandkids
at
all.
She
never
comes
over
to
see
them
either.
The
only
way
we
talk
to
her
is
if
my
husband
(her
son)
initiates
the
conversation
or
invites
her
to
things.
If
we
text
or
call
he
or
video
call
her
then
she
talks
to
or
sees
her
grandkids
or
if
we
invite
her
to
somewhere
that
we're
going
to
be.
I've
come
to
the
realization
that
she
never
reaches
out
on
her
own
for
anything.
Our
kids
seem
to
be
uncomfortable
around
my
MIL
because
of
their
lack
of
time
with
her.
I
told
my
husband
that
we
should
stop
reaching
out
to
my
MIL
to
see
how
long
we
would
go
before
she
would
finally
reach
out
to
talk
to
or
see
her
grandkids.
AITA
for
stopping
the
communication
until
my
MIL
puts
in
some
effort?EDIT:
my
MIL
has
since
moved
further
away
and
only
ever
wants
us
to
go
to
her
place
and
never
comes
to
ours

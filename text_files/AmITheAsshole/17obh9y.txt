So I (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together
for around 3 years and are currently living together. For
some time now his friends has been casually dropping comments
to me about our sex life, for example “so I
heard you and … had sex this morning” and “oh
I heard you gave it to him good last night”
which has been making me uncomfortable. At first I told
my boyfriend that I wasn’t comfortable with him discussing our
sex life because it’s our private life and I think
he sometimes forgets that it’s also affecting me and not
just him. He appears to have “forgotten” this because recently
it came up again and this time I was really
angry, i told him that if he continued to disrespect
me like this he soon won’t have anything it all
to share with his friends. He doesn’t seem to understand
the problem, so am I the asshole?
